bit   different  because |___________________) it's the biggest collection  I've
ever done.  When I'm looking back on my life,  several crews were founded by  me
and some friends.   K.d.ST.C,  The Druids,  The DJ's,  T.K.C.T.,  Alien Commando
and finally  The Sirius Cybernetics Corporation  back in 1990.  My world changed
constantly during those period and friends came and friends left.  Twelve  years
later .tSCc. looks different... I am different... we  experienced more  than one
crisis but we are  still present.  We are like digital titans who are walking on
the fields of their forefathers. Now... the summer of 2002 and I am again  on  a
turning point in my life... a point of confusion... I dunno where  I  wanna step
to next... I have finished my retraining school and I am unemployed right now...
It's the third time in my life that I am in this situation,  but  no matter what
happened in the past,  The Sirius Cybernetics Corporation always survived and we
will always survive...   F   O   R   E   V   E   R   !     http://tscc.atari.org

                                  PITFALL HARRY's DIARY

                                  Lost Cavern, Lat. 13.31øS, long 71.59øW
                                  Machu Pichu, Peru

                                  IN CASE YOU'RE WONDERING WHY I'M HERE

                                  Perhaps I've gone too far.   I'm  in  an
                                  underground   cavern   beneath  Peru. It
                                  seems to be a complex maze perhaps eight
                                  chambers wide  and over  three times  as
                  ___             deep.  Niece  Rhonda  has   disappeared,
                _/___\_           along with Quickclaw,  our cowardly cat.
              _/_______\_         I am beset by all manner of subterranean
             /___________\        creatures    in   this   vast,   ancient
     ..............:              labyrinth. And  all  because of a rock -
     :                            the RAJ diamond. It was stolen a century
     :                            ago,       and        hidden       here.

         Old friends, if ever you see this diary,             :
         I  hope you'll  read it  and come to  my           __:_
         aid.  Help me find Rhonda, Quickclaw and          /    \
         the diamond. On the way, let's also look         /      \
         for a stone-aged rat. A large university         \      /
         wants it for research.  Finally, lots of          \    /

                                  Rhonda,  Quickclaw, the diamond , all 28
     .............................gold bars  and  the  rat. And never fall
     :                            victim of a single danger.  Again though

     :                            Everything  else  is  gravy.  But  oh...
     :                            danger prevails.  Poisonous frogs, bats,
     :                            condors,    electric     eels,    albino
     :                            scorpions.   And  leaps  over dark voids
     :                            that dare me to fall to their fathomless
     :                            depths.  All  of  these PITFALLS must be
     :                            avoided.   I'm not  really sure  what'll
     :                            happen,  should  I succumb, but it can't
     :                            be   good.  I'll check  it out tomorrow.

                 OOOOO            Suddenly, a balloon floated overhead - a

                   .              curious.  Upon   closer   inspection,  I

                    .             carrying. She must've inflated them with
                   .              steam  from  an  underground geyser,  to
                   ...............signal  that she was still alive.  Dear,
                                  ever-resourceful Rhonda.



         Anyway,  just jump up and hang on. Float           ooo

         wait  for  a  bat  to  burst the balloon          OOOOO
