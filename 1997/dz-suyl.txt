(  ( ((( INTRO ))) )  )
   Howdy! yesterday (sunday) night i had a conversation with a guy called
   martz on irc. he asked me what groups i was in.. i answered "arcade
   (amiga) and wax" his reply to that was "wax is dead"!  it came as a
   shock to me. i mean we were a new group with some really kickass
   old and newskoolers! we didn't deserve to die. we weren't aiming to
   hurt anyone, and we had absolute NO intensions to make any war with
   anyone! our goal was having phun!
   some lame guy in the group was accusted of ripping. i knew that.
   he was kicked from the group as soon as drax and gravedancer found out
   that he had ripped. i knew that too. but that this had destroyed the
   group and its reputation so bad that the whole group was going down
   i had no idea! i couldn't even imagine that a thing like ONE rotten guy
   could sink a whole group!! i mean , the guy WAS kicked as soon as this
   ripping-thing came to the leaders knowledge! to all who have ANYTHING
   to do with this dirty business to do i just want to say  F U C K  Y O U !
   anyway.. martz then invited me to join SPIES. it was a offer i just
   could not resist! my knowladge when it comes to the pc ascii-scene are
   very limited as i'm quite new in this biz, but as far as i know SPIES
   is one of the top five groups (i dont know if that's your opinion too,
   but i dont care. i just hope that you evil suckers wont fuck this group
   up too, as you did with wax)!
   Since i joined yesterday and the pack is (atleast SHOULD be =)) out
   today (monday) i had no time making a lot of logos, but i figured that
   i atleast could do a couple of them for the pack.. so.. keep that in
   mind when watching this MICRO-colly without NO design at all!! =)
   over and out..     / Dez ^ arcade entertainment inc ^ spies sixfive!

   NOTE: when i wrote the shit ab0ve i wasn't stowned. now i am. but neway.. .
   dRaXxxX00o0r sended sum textFile to me that the guy who had beem akkused
   of the rippin thiNg xplained that he had been setTed up / foowlEd n sHit.
   if wat he writezz in that teXt is trUe, then i myst say that it is MOsT
   TRaGIC!! i dunno whst rotten pers0n could od that soet of thing, but i guess
   he is happy now when the pErson in questin have left thw scene (?) and wax
   is dead!!   .  .. .
