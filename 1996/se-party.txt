  |  But suddenly mysterious Mr.ƒ‰ni lurks here and says:                    |
  |  "Nyt kuule loppu se tenuttelu t‰h‰n! Pankahaas ne kaljat poies!"        |
  |  To specify Mr.ƒ‰ni's identification you should watch Abuse ASM'96       |
  |  official partyvideo!!                                                   |
  |                                                                          |
  |    "Return your votedisks", says SCALA... "NEVER!", yells bOHEME!        |
  |                                                                          |
  |  Æepe leaves this intro to someone else and runs away from Helsinki      |
  |  (not so)Fair Center. The ASM'96 is over! Atleast concerning me!         |
  |                                                                          | 
  |  Uh. Back home. Just showered myself (bOhEmE:) and began to finish this. |
  |  Had to make some adjustments 'cause the A1200 (THAT I BOUGHT!!!) had    |
 .|  a weird screenmode and those logos are pretty wide on my A500+.. oh,    |
 |\  maybe I should start tuning up my A1200. 10 years of OCS/ECS and now    |
  \  finally AGA! Ok, I won't bother you with that anymore.                  |
  |                                                                          |
  |  I must admit that rEPE was fucking clever. He didn't drink that much    |  
  |  during the party and now he's at the Kaivopuiston Kansanjuhla and I'm   |
  |  too fucking broken to go there..  terrible hangover.                    |
  |                                                                          |
  |  Asm-organizer were FAR too strict with booze'n'such.. come to SKENERY   |
  |  in Palokka (Jyvaskyl‰/Finland). Invitation intro is somewhere..         |
  |  It'll be more relaxed! I'm even one of the organizers:)                 |
  |                                                                          |
  |  In general, as I'm able to think stright now 'cause I'm sober (whou),   |
  |  ASSembly'96 was the comeback of Amiga-scene.. just take a look at       |
  |  those demos. They're all ASTOUNDINGLY AMAZINGLY GR8! Thanks to those    |
  |  involved.. you're gr8 too:)                                             | 
  |                                                                          |
  |  Well I think this intro must be the biggest intro ever in a colly..     |
 _|  ..so I stop here and catch me and the other dudes on iRC and such!   .__|
