   Three  years  ago I released my first ascii-colly "Touch Of God"
   (ending  .ans  this  time because of some ansis included) on 7th
   january  1999 after I tried to create asciis and ansis 1,5 years
   long  before.  Then followed `Pipi-Logic #1` also released under
   my old lable Zetec on 12th february.  At last came `city lights`
   under  Zetec  on 1st march with unique design and a little story
   arc I still like.
   With  the  next colly I opened my own ascii-group Off World as I
   did  not  dare to ask some elite one for joining - knowing about
   my  less  experiences  in  ascii-bizz  and bad style.  `Error in
   Line`99`  was  planed to be second colly, but due missing  story
   the  "real"  first  colly  for  Off  World  `Emergency Room` got
   released one month later on 23.o5.1999.
   Already  bored  by my new style I tried in `Visitors` to include
   several  styled  logos  and a true story I once lived through on
   22.o7.  Then I joined Layout, an ascii'n'friendship crew founded
   by  my  dear friend Aztec, but my planed opening colly "L.E.Mot"
   could not be finished in time and another Layout member - Juen -
   was  also  faster  then  me  so I released at first the fastmade
   `Leave  The  World  Behind`  on  22.10.  which  was planed to be
   released   at   Apocalypse   party  this  year.   With  `dID  iT
   fAAAAASTER!`  from  december '99  I hoped to help Juen with some
   logos  as  he  always  used the same ones saying his name, but I
   never  saw  him  using  them. :(   Coming `Efectin` a co-op with
   Kempy/Kore.   in April 2ooo - after a little pause because I met
   my  girl  Anja - a long dream of mine came true as Kempy was and
   still  is  a  very talented artist.  I hope to learn from him by
   letting remix my logos.  And I did!
   `Novelle Conscience` was a good concept and contained quite good
   logos  in my opinion.  It was released o7.o7.2ooo as this year I
   spent  most  of  my  time  with  Anja, not scening.  `The Raven`
   feat. Juen was  based on Poe's great poem and a nice teamwork we
   released  -  still under the flag of Layout - on o9.o7.  Shortly
   after  I  made `Think!` - a three days without sleep production.
   A  nice  trip  to  stay  awake for nearly four days spending the
   nights  on  ascii-making  while  listening  to my girl's breath.
   Then came `Absolute Beginner` where I tried to remix and improve
   Lahve's  logos,  but  I  failed in my opinion.  Lahve could have
   become a really skilled artist if he had continued making asciis
   after the 26.o9.
   Being  in  troubles, quitting my job, moving to another city and
   being a not-as-good-as-wanted ascii-artist I decided to quit the
   ascii-scene,  so  I  released a small colly independent with old
   unreleased  logos and other crap on o5.o3.2oo1.  But still being
   in  love  with  this  great kind of art I could not keep me away
   from  making  `Sauf-Pack`  on o6.o7.2oo1 and starting working on
   `Cafe Del Mar Vol. Seis` as guest release under Darkage. Shortly
   after  this  one  get  out in august I made `Nie rozumiem...` (I
   Don't  Understand)  under  Reason  as I felt more than motivated
   this  time and because Jurassic Pack - my diskmag - would take a
   while 'till the release.
   Finally  I  finished  `L.E.Mot` as good-bye-colly from Layout on
   o7.1o.2oo1 and joined 1oo% where I directly released `Apocalypse
   Is Near!` on 1o.1o.2oo1 - again a colly planned to  be  released
   at Apocalypse party where I could not attent this year too. Then
   followed `A Pink Night` on 28th same month which was meant to be
   a  little  homage on Pink/Abyss.  The last colly in 2001 was the
   serious  "Nothing's  Gonna  Change My World" from 12th december.
   In  this colly I introduced my new/improved style but this colly
   was  more  something  for the spirit than ascii-style stuff so I
   said  nothing  more  about this in the welcome words!  But now I
   want  to  state  that  this  is no new font, this is a developed
   design.  The old first one was plain and too simple.  The second
   one  was  better  and more stylish.  This one is really cool and
   not typical ascii-art because of the double lines and triangles.
   This makes it also look more like graffiti in my eyes.  Judge it
   on your own, but don`t say I would changed my style too often, I
   just developed...
   This  colly now is a bit serious again and features the words of
   Chief  Seattle.  But it is just a small one - 7 logos because 21
   collies  divided  by  3  years makes 7.  ;) Also I have to write
   that  the name of this colly has nothing in common with the once
   famous  ascii-crew "Save Our Souls", it is just connected to the
   letter  of  Chief  Seathl (Seattle) of the Suwamish Tribe to the
   President of the United States of America, Franklin Pierce 1854.

           The  Great  Chief  in  Washington  sends word that he
           wishes  to  buy our land.  The Great Chief also sends
           us  words  of friendship and good will.  This is kind
           of  him,  since  we  know  he  has little need of our
           friendship  in  return.   But  we  will consider your
           offer.  For we know that if we do not sell, the white
           man may come with guns and take our land.
           But  how  can  you  buy or sell the sky?  The warmth?
           The  land?   The idea is strange to us.  If we do not
           own  the  freshness of the air and the sparkle of the
           water, how can you buy them?

           Every  part  of  this  earth  is sacred to my people.
           Every  shining  pine needle, every sandy shore, every
           mist  in  the dark woods, every meadow, every humming
           insect.  All are holy in the memory and experience of
           my people.
           We know the sap which courses through the trees as we
           know  the  blood  that courses through our veins.  We
           are  part  of  the  earth  and it is part of us.  The
           perfumed  flowers  are  our  sisters.   The bear, the
           deer,  the  great eagle, these are our brothers.  The
           rocky crests, the juices in the meadow, the body heat
           of the pony, and man, all belong to the same family.

           The  shining  water  that  moves  in  the streams and
           rivers  is  not  just  water,  but  the  blood of our
           ancestors.   If  we  sell  you  our  land,  you  must
           remember  that it is sacred.  Each ghostly reflection
           in  the clear waters of the lakes tells of events and
           memories  in  the  life  of  my  people.  The water's
           murmur is the voice of my father's father.
           The rivers are our brothers.  They quench our thirst.
           They  carry our canoes and feed our children.  So you
           must  give  to the rivers the kindness you would give
           any brother.
                                      .

           If  we  sell  you  our land, remember that the air is
           precious  to  us, that the air shares its spirit with
           all  the  life  it  supports.  The wind that gave our
           grandfather  his  first breath also receives his last
           sigh.  The wind also gives our children the spirit of
           life.   So  if we sell you our land, you must keep it
           apart  and  sacred,  as  a  place where man can go to
           taste  the  wind  that  is  sweetened  by  the meadow
           flowers.
           Will  you teach your children what we have taught our
           children?   That  the  earth is our mother?  Whatever
           befalls the earth befalls all the sons of the earth.

           This  we know:  the earth does not belong to man, man
           belongs  to the earth.  All things are connected like
           the  blood that unites us all.  Man did not weave the
           web  of  life, he is merely a strand in it.  Whatever
           he does to the web, he does to himself.
           One  thing  we  know:  our god is also your god.  The
           earth  is precious to him and to harm the earth is to
           heap contempt on its creator.

           Your  destiny  is  a mystery to us.  What will happen
           when  the  buffalo  are  all  slaughtered?   The wild
           horses  tamed?   What  will  happen  when  the secret
           comers of the forest are heavy with the scent of many
           men  and  the  view  of  the ripe hills is blotted by
           talking  wires?   Where  will  the thicket be?  Gone!
           Where  will  the  eagle be?  Gone!  And what is it to
           say  goodbye to the swift pony and the hunt?  The end
           of living and the beginning of survival.
           When   the   last  Red  Man  has  vanished  with  his
           wilderness  and  his  memory  is only the shadow of a
           cloud  moving  across  the prairie, will these shores
           and  forests still be here?  Will there be any of the
           spirit of my people left?

           We  love  this  earth as a newborn loves its mother's
           heartbeat.   So,  if we sell you our land, love it as
           we have loved it.  Care for it as we have cared fort.
           Hold  in  your  mind  the memory of the land as it is
           when  you  receive  it.   Preserve  the  land for all
           children and love it, as God loves us all.
           As  we  are part of the land, you too are part of the
           land.   This  earth  is  precious  to us.  It is also
           precious  to  you.  One thing we know:  there is only
           one  God.  No man, be he Red Man or White Man, can be
           apart.  We are brothers after all.
