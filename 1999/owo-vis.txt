 ONE OF MY FRIENDS READ A BOOK ONCE AND AFTER HE FINISHED IT HE DISAPPEARED
 WITHOUT LEAVING A TRACE. BEFORE HE VANISHED HE TOLD ME ABOUT THIS FABULOUS
 BOOK AND ITS TOPIC - ALIENS ON EARTH!!!  SOME OF HIS `FRIENDS` SAID HE HAS
 GONE BECAUSE OF HIS LOVE OVERSEA.   OTHERS THOUGHT IT WAS BECAUSE HIS DRUG
 PROBLEMS WITH ONE OF THE LOCAL DEALERS. I DON`T UNDERSTAND HIM LEAVING HIS
 HOMETOWN. I SAW NO REASON IN HIS ACTION UNTIL I READ THE BOOK HE  TOLD  ME
 ABOUT.  LET ME TELL YOU NOW WHAT I READ THERE ABOUT THINGS HAPPEN ON EARTH
 EVERYONE CAN IMAGE BUT DON`T BELIEVE IN IT. LET ME TELL YOU THE TRUTH...

 OF  COURSE  HAD  I  SEEN THE `X-FILES` AND I FOUND IT VERY INTERESTING AND
 ENTERTAINING TOO BUT I WAS NOT A BELIEVER  AS  MULDER  SHOWED  ONE.  DON`T
 THINK  NOW THAT I WAS AN IGNORANT WHO SAID THAT THERE COULDN`T BE ANY FORM
 OF LIVE IN THE UNIVERSE. I THINK PEOPLE TELLING THIS  ARE  STUPID  BECAUSE
 THEY  HAVE  NO  KNOWLEDGE  ABOUT THE SIZE OF IT. NO IMAGINATION! WITH PURE
 MATHEMATICS IS ANOTHER LIFEFORM ONLY IN OUR GALAXY POSSIBLE AT LEAST ABOUT
 TEN THOUSAND DIFFERENT OTHER KINDS THEN US!!! AND THERE  ARE  BILLIONS  OF
 OTHER  GALAXIES  OUT  THERE. OF COURSE WOULD IT BE A BIG PROBLEM TO TRAVEL
 BETWEEN TWO GALAXIES BECAUSE OF THE VERY LARGE DISTANCE  EVEN  IF  WE  HAD
 THE  WARP-TECHNOLOGY,  BUT  WHAT  COUNTS  IS  THAT ANOTHER LIFEFROM SURELY
 EXISTS.  THE  ONLY  QUESTION  IS  IF IT WILL GET IN CONTACT WITH THE HUMAN
 RACE OR MAYBE STILL HAS CONTACTED OUR  GOVERNMENTS  WHICH  ARE  BUSY  WITH
 HIDING THEM FROM US...

 ONE NIGHT I DECIDED TO START READING THE BOOK.  ABOUT  ONE  YEAR  AFTER MY
 FRIENDS  DEPARTURE.  HE  WAS ONE OF MY BEST FRIENDS AND IT WAS HARD FOR ME
 LOSING HIM SO I HAD TO WORK UP AT FIRST THE THINGS THAT HAPPENED.  IN THIS
 NIGHT  I  FELT  LIKE I HEARD A VOICE TELLING ME ABOUT MY FRIEND I TRIED TO
 FORGET. THE VOICE FORCED ME TO STAND UP AND GO INTO THE OTHER ROOM  OF  MY
 SMALL  APARTMENT  IN  MIDTOWN. I WENT TO THE BIG CUPBOARD ON THE LEFT SIDE
 AND OPENED ITS BIG DOOR. I TOOK THE SHORTS AND JACKETS BESIDE AND SEARCHED
 FOR A LITTLE BLACK BOX. I DIDN`T KNOW WHY I DID THIS BUT I DID! AND THEN I
 FOUND IT AND I KNEW WHY I NEEDED IT. IT WAS THE BOX WITH A FEW THINGS FROM
 MY  FRIEND. I REMEMBERED! I TOOK THE BOX OUT OF THE CUPBOARD AND OPENED IT
 AND THE FIRST THING I SAW WAS THE BOOK...  FASTLY I SNATCHED AT IT AND RAN
 BACK  INTO  MY  SLEEPING  ROOM  AND  JUMPED  INTO  MY WARM BED LEAVING THE
 CUPBOARD AND THE DOORS OPEN. I SWITCH THE BEDLIGHT ON AND  STARED  AT  THE
 FRONT PICTURE OF THE BOOK IN MY HANDS...

 I WAS SCARED FOR THE FIRST SECONDS. IN THE FIRST  MOMENT  I  HAD  THE  BAD
 FEELING  I  HAD  ALREADY SEEN THE PERSON ON THE BOOK BEFORE. BUT PERSON IS
 THE WRONG WORD FOR WHAT WAS  PRINTED  THERE.  IT  WAS  RATHER  A  CREATURE
 WATCHING ME. PARANOIA TOOK CONTROL OVER ME AND I HAD  TO  THROW  THE  BOOK
 AWAY.  AFTER SOME MINUTES OF REST I GOT THE COURAGE TO STAND UP, CATCH THE
 BOOK, THAT  WAS  LYING BENEATH THE LITTLE HI-FI TOWER I BOUGHT MYSELF LAST
 MONTH FROM THE MONEY I HAD TO WORK A HALF YEAR FOR,  AND RETURN TO MY BED.
 I TOOK ME A HEART AND START AGAIN DISCOVERING THE BOOK MY FRIEND LEFT  ME.
 THE CREATURE ON THE COVER SHOWED THE TYPICAL ALIEN FACE ONE  COULD SEE ALL
 OVER  THE  WORLD  THESE  DAYS. EVERYWHERE. BIG BLACK EYES LIKE SEAS WITH A
 LITTLE  GLITTERING  IN  IT. EYES I WILL NEVER FORGET! A SMALL MOUTH LIKE A
 THIN LINE ONLY A VERY FINE PENCIL CAN DRAW. A TINY NOSE BETWEEN THEM - NOT
 AS DOMINATING AS THE HUMAN  ONE - WITH  TWO HOLES THAT SEEMED TO REACH THE
 MOUTH NEARLY. A LONG FACE WITH A POINTED CHIN. IF ONE HAVED LOOKED CLOSELY
 ONE COULD SEE SHADES OF A LONG, THIN NECK, NOT EASY TO  SEE.  I  WAS  MORE
 THAN  FASCINATED  BY  THE  PICTURE OF AN ALIEN PERSON, BUT SO KNOWN FOR ME
 WITHOUT ANY REASON. AFTER WATCHING AT IT FOR A WHILE I  TURNED  THE  FIRST
 PAGE AND ONE PART OF A SENTENCE CAME STRAIGHT TO MY EYES:  ...A TRUE STORY

 I KNOW ENOUGH PEOPLE WHO CLAIMED TO TELL THE ONLY AND HOLY TRUTH,  BUT ALL

 THEY WERE NOT SURE IF THEY TOLD IT ALWAYS THE SAME WAY - THE SAME TRUTH...
 TELL ME, READER,  WOULD YOU BELIEVE PEOPLE TELLING YOU THAT ONLY THEM WERE

 WON`T. FOR SURE!

 ONCE,  A  WHILE BEFORE MY FRIEND DISAPPEARED, I HAD A VISION. AN AUTHENTIC
 ONE THAT SEEMS SO REAL IN MY MEMORIES THAT I STILL FEEL ITS PRESENCE TODAY
 EVERYTIME I AM THINKING ABOUT IT.  I DON`T KNOW IF IT IS OR WAS NECCESSARY
 FOR THE TOPIC OR FOR THE VANISHING OF MY FRIEND,  BUT IF OR IF NOT I THINK
 IT IS BETTER TO TELL IT RIGHT HERE THAN TO CLOSE IT FOREVER IN  MY  BRAIN.
 MAYBE IT WILL HELP TO UNDERSTAND MY OPINION AND THOUGHTS  ABOUT THIS STORY
 OR AT LEAST GIVES YOU SOMETHING YOU CAN READ AND PERHAPS TALK  ABOUT.  AND
 HERE IT COMES...

    IT HAS BEEN A FINE DAY,  THIS SUNDAY.  I HAVE BEEN ON TOUR WITH SOME
    FRIENDS OF MINE, INCLUDING THE SPECIAL  ONE,  AND  MY  BELOVED  GIRL
    FRIEND,  IF YOU COULD HAVE CALLED IT BELOVED IN  THAT AGE I WAS THAT
    TIME.  BIKING THROUGH THE ROUGH LANDSCAPE OF OUR COUNTRY WE HAD FELT
    THE ENERGY OF NATURE AND THE STRENGH OF OUR  BODIES.  IT  HAS  BEGAN
    WHEN WE HAD PAUSED  FOR  A  WHILE,  NOT  TALKING,  JUST  TO  RELAXE.
    SOMETHING HAD HAPPENED, BECAUSE THE NEXT THING  I  REMEMBERED WAS ME
    TAKING A SHOWER LATE IN THE EVENING OF THIS DAY.  I HAD NO KNOWLEDGE
    WHAT HAPPENED BETWEEN THIS BREAK AND THE MOMENT I WAS STANDING IN MY
    BATHROOM IN A WARM RAIN.  IN A FEELING OF DISORDER I HAD MADE ME DRY
    AND HAD WENT TO BED. BUT I HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO FALL ASLEEP SO I HAD
    BEEN  LYING IN MY  BED FOR HOURS WATCHING THE CEILING OF MY CHAMBER.
    LATE AT NIGHT I HAD BEGAN TO WENT TIRED  BUT  SUDDENLY  I`D  FELT  A
    POWER  OF  UNKNOWN  ORIGIN  THAT FORCED ME TO STAND UP AND GO TO THE
    WINDOW AND WATCH OUT OF IT.  I  HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO BELIEVE IN WHAT
    I  HAD  SEEN  ON  THE SKY THIS NIGHT. IT HASN`T BEEN THE MOON AS THE
    MOST PEOPLE I TALKED WITH ABOUT LATER TRIED TO TELL MY. WELL, IT HAS
    BEEN SIMILAR TO IT BUT IT HAS BEEN SO MUCH BIGGER THAT THERE HAD NOT
    BEEN MUCH SPACE LEFT FOR SOME STARS.  IT HAS TAKEN THE WHOLE SIZE OF
    MY  WINDOW.  FROM  THE  RIGHT  END  `TILL THE LEFT. AND IT HAS HAD A
    STRANGE YELLOW-LIKE COLOR.  FULL.  EXCEPT SOME SMALL AREAS WHERE THE
    SHADOWS OF A FEW MOUNTAINS AND CRATERS HAD TAKEN PLACE. JUST LIKE ON
    THE MOON BUT IN OTHER POSITIONS AND NUMBERS.  LATER  WHEN  I SAW THE
    ANIMATION MOVIE WHERE WALACE & GROMMIT FLEW TO THE MOON BECAUSE THEY
    THOUGHT IT WAS MADE OF CHEESE  I  REMEMBERED  THIS  NIGHT.  I  CAN`T
    REMEMBER  TODAY  THAT  I  HAD LEFT THE PLACE ON THE WINDOW. THE ONLY
    THING THAT COMES INTO MY MINDS IS ME - STANDING ON THE OPENED WINDOW
    AND WATCHING THIS SKY-THING WHICH HAS BEEN MAYBE A PLANET.
    THIS  TIME  IT HAS BEEN JUST AN EXPERIENCE FOR ME THAT MOST  OF  THE
    OTHER  KIDS HAD TRIED TO GET BY SMOKING JOINTS OR TAKING XTC OR LSD.
    WELL, I HAD FOUND IT WAS `REALLY COOL`, BUT I HAD NEVER THOUGHT THAT
    IT  WOULD  HAVE  SUCH  AN INFLUENCE TO THE FUTURE AS I DO TODAY - AT
    LEAST THINK IT COULD HAD HAVE - MAYBE...

 BUT BACK TO THE BOOK I WANTED TO READ IN THE NIGHT ABOUT  ONE  YEAR  AFTER
 THIS (I WROTE ABOUT SOME LINES AHEAD).
 WITH THIS NON-AGREMENTS ABOUT A SENTENCE LIKE `A TRUE STORY`  I DECIDED TO
 START  READING  ALTHOUGH,  ESPECIALLY I GOT THE FEELING THAT I HAD TO READ
 THIS, SO YOU CAN`T CALL ME A VOLUNTARY READER AT  THE  BEGINNING  OF  THIS
 NIGHT BUT THAT FACT WOULD STILL CHANGE MINUTES LATER.

 THE AUTHOR NORMALLY WROTE FOR NEWSPAPERS AND ALSO HAD RELEASED SOME HORROR
 NOVELS, IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN SUCH FACTS. AND IT IS A LIE  IF  I  WOULD
 TELL  YOU  NOW  THAT  I WAS NOT CAUGHT BY HIS STYLE OF WRITING. ALTHOUGH I
 WASN`T A BELIEVER, AS I ALREADY MENTIONED, I WAS VERY INTERESTED  WHAT  HE
 WROTE. SO I FINALLY STARTED TO READ THE FIRST WORD.  THE  FIRST  SENTENCE.
 THE FIRST PAGE. THE FIRST CHAPTER...

 JUST  A  NORMAL  DAY IN A NORMAL LIFE OF A NORMAL MAN. A WIFE AND A KID. A
 HOUSE IN A SMALL VILLAGE (A HOLLIDAY HOUSE ONLY BY THE WAY). BUT  THEN  IT
 CAME REALLY ASS KICKING.  THE  MAN KNEW THAT SOMETHING WERE WRONG WITH HIM
 AND ALSO WITH HIS KID BUT HE DIDN`T KNOW WHAT.  THE DOCTOR`S FOUND NOTHING
 AND HIS WIFE ALSO DIDN`T BELIEVE HIM (AS IT ALWAYS IS).  THEN HE FOUND OUT
 THAT  HE  WAS CARRIED OFF BY BEINGS SO-CALLED ALIENS. HE WENT TO A SPECIAL
 MEETING  OF  PERSONS  WHO CLAIMED THAT THE SAME HAPPENED TO THEM. BUT THAT
 SHATTERED.  THE PROTAGONIST, THAT IS THE AUTHOR HIMSELF, WENT THEREFORE TO
 A SPECIAL DOCTOR WHO PRACTICES HYPNOSIS AND THERE HE FOUND OUT WHAT REALLY
 HAPPENED  TO  HIM  AND HIS FAMILY AND WHO THE YOUNG WOMAN WAS HE MET A DAY
 BEFORE ON THE STREET THINKING TO KNOW HER BUT DIDN`T KNOW FROM WHERE...

 UNTIL THAT IT WAS MORE A DIARY OR A GOOD  TOLD  MAINSTREAM  NOVEL  THAN  A
 BOOK TO  SCARE  THE  READER BUT THAT HAD CHANGED A CHAPTER LATER - CHAPTER
 TWO!  IN  HYPNOSIS  THE  MAN  SAW NOW EVERYTHING CLEARLY, FOR EXAMPLE THAT
 HE MET THE YOUNG WOMAN IN A SPACESHIP WHERE BOTH OF THEM WERE TAKEN TO  BY
 ALIEN PERSONS. THEN HE GOT INTO DETAILS:  THE HOLIDAYS,  THE NIGHT WERE HE
 HEARD  SOME  STRANGE NOICES BUT CAN`T REMEBER THAT HE HAD WOKE UP BUT THAT
 HE TALKED TO HIS WIFE, BUT THERFORE SHE DIDN`T REMEMBER THAT  HE  TOLD  TO
 HER.  `I WAS SLEEPING THE WHOLE NIGHT!`  SHE  SAID. AND THE DETAILS BECAME
 HARD - THE ALIENS TOOK HIM TO ANOTHER PLACE WHERE HE WAS ALONE  AND  WHERE
 HE  WAS  NAKED  AND  THEN THEY MADE THE THINGS WITH HIM SO MANY PEOPLE ARE
 TELLING  ON  TELEVISION  THAT  ALIENS  DID  IT  WITH  THEM THESE DAYS. AND
 SUDDENLY  MY  ASS  HURTED...  AAAAHHHHH! DAMNED!!! DID I DREAM OR WHAT WAS
 THAT.  UUUHHHH!  WAS THAT REAL! THE LITTLE LAMP ON MY BEDSIDE TABLE SEEMED
 TO BE TO LESS LIGHT - NOT ENOUGH TO BEWARE OF THOSES BEASTS WHO  HAD  COME
 TO  EARTH TO CATCH ME - BUT I DIDN`T FELT THE COURAGE TO STAND UP AND TURN
 ON THE BIG ONE BECAUSE I SAW A LITTLE  SHAPE  ON  THE  WINDOW:  WHITE  AND
 NEARLY  ONE  METER  HIGH.  `HELLO` I ASKED BUT NO ONE, NOT TO SAY NOTHING,
 ANSWERED. AGAINST MY FEARS I CONTINUED TO READ.
 AND  I  READ  UNTIL TWO O`CLOCK IN THE MORNING MORE THAN THE FIRST HALF OF
 THE BOOK! BUT THERE WAS SOME HUMAN THING I HAD TO DO,  BECAUSE I DRANK TOO
 MUCH BEER THE EVENING BEFORE. SLOWLY I STOOD UP, ALWAYS LOOKING AROUND ME,
 BEHIND ME, TWO TIMES A SECOND. I REACHED THE BATHROOM NOT FAR AWAY FROM ME
 AND  TURNED  THE  LIGHT  ON.  WHAT...  THERE WAS SOMETHING AT THE BATHROOM
 WINDOW, I SWEAR! AS FAST AS I COULD I DID WHAT I HAD TO DO, TURNED OFF THE
 LIGHT  END  RAN  BACK  INTO MY BED. DAMNED!! I HAD FORGOT TO SWITCH ON THE
 LIGHT OF MY ROOM THAT I WANTED TO DO BEFORE. WELL, AT THIS  POINT  I  FELT
 NOT  STRONG  ENOUGH  TO STAND UP AGAIN, SO I STOOD IN MY BED AND CONTINUED
 READING THE STRANGE BOOK, NOT WONDERING  ABOUT  THE  STRANGE  REACTION  IT
 MADE ON ME OR WHERE THIS INFLUENCE CAME FROM...

 AS THE TIME HAS GONE BY I FELT IN A LETARGIC MOOD AND  WENT A  BIT  TIRED,
 BECAUSE I HAD THE WHOLE DAY BEFORE TO WORK AS A CONSTRUCTION WORKER ON THE
 MILLENIUM  TOWER,  BUT  I FORCED MYSELF TO CONTINUE READING. AT THE END OF
 THE NIGHT I FINISHED IT. I SPENT THE WHOLE NIGHT BENEATH THE BLANKET IN MY
 BED IN FEAR OF EVERY NOISE I HEARD SOMEWHERE...ANYWHERE.  I  FELT  LIKE  A
 LITTLE CHILD WHO HAS BEEN WAITING FOR THEIR PARENTS TO COME HOME TO BANISH
 THE GHOSTS FROM ITS ROOM. WHILE  READING  I  SMOKED  ONE  CIGARETTE  AFTER
 ANOTHER  AFTER  ANOTHER  AFTER... TO ABANDON THE SHAKINGS FROM MY BONES. I
 HEARD `THEM` WISPERING NOT KNOWING WHO `THEM` WERE AND THE SAME MOMENT THE
 SUN ROSE UP I TURNED OVER THE LAST PAGE AND READ THE WORDS `THE END` AND I
 WAS GLAD ABOUT IT.

 BUT SUDDENLY I STOOD ON THE ROOF OF THE SMALER BUILDING NEXT TO MY WINDOW.
 TWO METERS FAR FROM AN OLD SMOKESTACK LOOKING INTO A PAIR  OF  BLACK  EYES
 LIKE DEEP AND DEEPER SEAS. IT WAS ONE OF THOSE HUMAN-LIKE CREATURES I READ
 ABOUT IN THE MYSTERIOUS BOOK. IT WAS LESS THAN ONE METER HIGH  AND  HAD  A
 SNOW-WHITE  SKIN.  IT  LOOKED  BACK!  AND WITH THE HIGH-HOLD FINGER OF ITS
 RIGHT HAND IT SAID TO ME WITH THE VOICE OF THE VANISHED FRIEND OF MINE:

 `THERE IS MORE BEHIND THE BLUE PAINTED SKY. PROVE YOUR  RELIGION  MAN  AND
  YOU WILL UNDERSTAND WHAT WE ARE...`

 I WOKE UP THE NEXT MORNING AS IF I TOOK A LONG REST AND I WAS HAPPY  ABOUT
 LIFE. DIDN`T KNOW WHY THE WORLD SEEMED SO BRIGHT THIS DAY, BUT I CARED NOT
 ABOUT IT. I JUST ENJOYED IT...
