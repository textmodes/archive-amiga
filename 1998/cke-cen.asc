  It was another glorius day at the DASK ranch in Hadsten. Evertything was
nice. The sun was shining, it was summer and  the  nice  shemales  outside
were all dressed in tiny bikinies. And for  the first time in many  months
none of the DASK gangsters were having hangovers. Everyone had been  awake
since sunrise. This was not only  caused by brilliant  weather and the hot
shemales outside, no, this was caused by the exitement  everyone had about
the big DASK WHQ party that were to be held the same night. This  would be
the first time where the ever toasted DASK people met with the evil  beer-
monkies of KLAN for many months (last meeting ended up in  drugs and  sex-
orgies).
  The famous DASK WHQ party were to be held at Baloo's place,  so everyone
was seeking high and low to find his  appartment. After a couple of  hours
of intensive searching Flower suddently  pointed his  clumsy fingers at an
old and rotten cottage and said "hhhey, mm, look it's the  partey place!".
And Spice1 one pushed the car to its maximum.
  At the party place Baloo stood with a sly grin on his face. "hehe,  come
closer my dear friends" he wispered. "eww, something is wrong"  Cake  said
in a desperate tone to the rest of the gang, "he's usually  never kind  to
our kind" he continued. "Do not worry dear friends, we have plenty of weed
and glue inside, and as a special treatment, i  have ordered  some *fresh*
party-girls" Baloo said with a convincing voice, "you like them eh?".
  What could they do else than get out of the car, and run  like hell into
the old cottage. "Oh, by the way, do not  shut the..argh!"  was  all  that
Baloo  had time to say  before the old  cottage front crashed  down on the
poor DASK people. "Ouch! Shit what  a rotten cottage!!"  Flower  said, "oh
no, and now i coursed!". "Hmm, who gives a  jack-ass about  Baloo's  house
anyways" Spice1 one said and took the shiny bag of glue out from his dusty
jacket.
  "It is p-a-r-t-y time!" Spice1 said while shaking the halfopened bag  of
glue. "Nice move, but where the heck are those KLAN peeps?" Cake said, and
grabbed after Spice1's glue-bag.

<Some minutes parses>
 
  "w00t w00t - im Thomas the Tankengine" Flower says while crawling around
on the yellow grass. "Heh, sure you are" Spice1 replied and climbed on top
of Flower, who had started to "drive" in the ruins of Baloo's cottage.
  "What has happend here?!" - It was a strange voice that shouted  towards
the playing DASK gangsters. "Ow fuck, it's the KLAN posse!" Cake said, and
ran for shelter behind Flower/Spice1's "tankengine".
  "No worry, we don't want to shoot you" Gdd said with a convincing voice,
"but we would really appreciate it if you left atonce!" it was Mr.Mox  who
had jumped of his motorbike, and was now standing on the  ground holding a
big shotgun, which was pointed at the "tankengine". "Guess it is time  for
us to find another rail-way" Spice1 said, and drove the  Flower-tankengine
away from Baloo's party place.
  "Dont worry guys" Cake said as he crawled down the dusty road to Hadsten
centrum, "we'll just grab a slice of pizza before we  head towards Vejle".
"You don't suppose they still  have that  pizza with  the "horns" still??"
Flower said with a sly smile on his face.
