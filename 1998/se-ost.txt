      |`-'   | here we have a very weird animal called ostrich. it sounds |
      ||     | like german,  I really prefer strutsi better,  but I can't |
      || sTZ!| use that word. ok, ostrich reminds a little bit of giraff. |
   ___||___  | difference  is that ostrich use only 2 leg for walking and |
  /   '    \ | it has feathers'n'shit. ostrich does not live old. it dies |
 (  /     \ )| about in  the age  of 2 years.  you really should  see the |
 ( /_______/ | growing part. fast, when ostrich is born, it is about 10cm |
 (/ | | \ \ _|_ and after 10-15 days it is already 1 meter tall. likes to |
    | |  \ ( / ) listen bob marley and smoke some weed with good friends! |
