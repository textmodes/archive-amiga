          Ofcourse there are more good oldskoolers out there, its just
          that i didnt want to do this one 200kb or something, no this
          1 was just ment to be a little quickie. So i decided to only
          include logos for the top TEN oldskoolers in the pece-scene.
          That means that there are quite alot great artists that does
          not making it all the way to the top including great artists
          Serial 2n, Whodini, Kayozz, C4nn, Necronite and Necrom among
          others. I really respect you guys too, its just that..that..
          i dont know, you didn't qualify among the top 10.. if it was
          the top 20 no one of you guys  would have any trouble at all
          getting in here, but it aint. So.. perhaps the most glorious
          and best sign of what ppl really think of your art is to get
          in this tribute collection! Yeah! I rock'n'roll!
            Who am i trying to fool? This is just Bullshit! This colly
          aint more 'prestigious' than any other respect colly. infact
          its more like LESS 'prestigious' than others. Coz im not one
          of those big artists with cool styles and shit.  But if i am
          gonna be 100% honest i really think  that my new style looks
          good! And the fact that i'm in the BEST OLDSKOOL ASCII GROUP
          IN THE PEECEE-SCENE (dont believe me? look for yourself down
          after the logos 4 proof!), together with guys like /\RLEQUIN
          SQUISH, TIM DR/\KE and VOLATILE, should also be a proof that
          my style is pretty good! maybe i should have done a respect-
          logo for myself in this one!? WTF!? That's enuff! I cant be-
          lieve how you tolerate that i am going on like this!! beeing
          this selfish and shit. This is a  r e s p e c t !  colly for
          the ones i truly respect. i dont think of myslf as higher or
          better than anyone else, no no, i leave that for TUM/REMORSE
          (read more about it after the logos) that seriously seems to
          think that he, beeing the remorser he is, is a better human-
          beeing than non-remorsers!  G E T  R E A L , T U M !   / Dez

  reply to wh/\t TUM wrote in the infofile for RMRS #19
 -------------------------------------------------------

    OBSERVE: I'VE GOT NOTHING AGAINST RMRS, I JUST WANT TO 'CLEAR THINGS UP'
             A BIT AS TUM HIMSELF SAYS. PLEASE TAKE THE TIME TO READ IT ALL!


      Before we start i would just like to point out that this is the first
      time ever i write a reply to what someone else writes! How come that i
      did it this time? Well.. it's not that i think he is totally screwed,
      or that i want some kind of war with TUM or something like that, and i
      am NOT one of those who hates RMRS and everything they does.. no infact
      i like Remorse alot and think that they are, with no competition, the
      absolute number one PEECEE-ascii/ansi group! Btw.. These are *MY* views
      on things.. they aren't necessary shared or supported by any of the groups
      i am in.  So please dont involve them in any ev. reply to this text, ok?


  [ let the game begin ]

tum> Just to set this straight: Apparently there has been some confusion
tum> lately as to which group is truly the "best" in the scene. Let us
tum> clear this up. Remorse always has and always will dominate both the
tum> newschool and oldschool forums.

      not that fast mr TUM! the best group in the scene? if that is what you
      think, then thats ok, but what bothers me is the next sentence..
      "remorse always has and always will dominate both the newschool and
      oldschool forums." hmm.. really? Newschool-domination? That i can buy,
      but OLDSCHOOL DOMINATION??  haha.. hardly think so!  Ever heard of groups
      like STYLE, LOW PROFILE, ARCLITE, JEDI ARTS, EPSILON DESIGN?? I say that
      ALL those ami-groups beats the shit out of RMRS when it comes to oldskool!
      I really like rmrs, they got awesome newskoolers and some pretty good
      oldskoolers, but they dont have ANYONE CLOSE to Mogue, Mark Ryder, Ramon,
      Ranx, Shapechanger and Zeus, for just mentioning a few! I say that the
      ONLY oldskooler EVER in the history of the peecee-ascii scene that's able
      to compete with those guys is HIRO PROTAGONIST! But not even Hiro is even
      close to beeing in the same class as the 15-20 top ami ertists tho' times!


tum> The mature ascii quality of each member of Remorse, the domination that
tum> the group holds over #ascii, and ultimately, the fact that we are the
tum> oldest and strongest ascii group around confirm this.

      The quality of the rmrs-artists works are usually VERY high, i agree
      with you there. But, correct me if i'm wrong, does the fact that you
      guys holds an irc-channel really confirms that you guys are the 'oldest
      and strongest1? I dont think so. btw.. OLDEST, huh? Are you really sure
      on that one? Correct me if i'm wrong, but wasnt remorse (todays remorse)
      founded 1996?  I have collys from 1995 with groups like EPSILON DESIGN,
      MO'SOUL, STYLE, SAVE OUR SOULS and others.. I dont know how old those
      groups are, they might older than that, but what's important is that rmrs
      is NOT the oldest one!


tum> When people think "ascii" the first and most established group that
tum> comes to mind is always Remorse.

      Really? When *I* (and i think many with me) hear the word "ascii", the
      first and most established group that comes to my mind is *not* rmrs..
      it's Epsilon Design! You are all the time forgetting that there are some
      phat AMIGA-GROUPS out there as well!!


tum> What other group can boast having new school titans like Mr. Self Destruct,
tum> Axel Barebones, Killa Hertz, Mr. Kite, Pariah, Atom Bomb (wink wink),
tum> Kaleidas and myself in its ranks? OK, OK, maybe *I* don't really belong on
tum> that list, but we all get the picture. :)

      None. Coz when it comes to newskool rmrs kicks buttocks! And btw..
      dont be that modest Tum, you DO belong in that list and you know it!
      Even though i dont agree with all you have written here, i cant deny
      (and i see no reason, why i should!) the fact that you are one of the
      absolute best newskoolers tho' times! =)


tum> And not only do we hold newschool in our hands, but we have Whodini,
tum> Hiro Protagonist, Megga Hertz, Fahrenheit, and the founder of Remorse,
tum> Necromancer in the flesh. The list goes on and on. We have been the best,
tum> we are the best, we will always be the best. We don't need to disguise
tum> inferior work with higher ascii characters or produce mass volumes of
tum> lower quality logos. If it's in a Remorse pack, there's a certain minimum
tum> level of quality and skill associated with it.

      bah. here we go again.. (repeating myself? me? you must be kidding!)
      Your oldskool team is in NO way the best.. Hiro, Whodini, Fahrenheit,
      Merlin, Truman.. sure, they are good, some are really good, but then
      again compare those to the top amiga-artists and you should realise
      what i am talking about. It would be like a Hockey game between Sweden
      and some south african country where the players have never even heard
      of ice!


tum> Remorse doesn't follow trends, we set them. All major advances up to the
tum> present the scene have come from the sincere and solid efforts of our
tum> members. It's delusional to pretend otherwise.

      All major ones? I hardly think that none of the the top Ami-groups
      doesnt have had any major influence on the art-scene..


tum> "Remorse ego" you may claim. "Badass 81 attitude!" you may cry. Yes. I
tum> completely agree with you. We have ego and we have a badass attitude but
tum> only because we deserve it. When your rich uncle buys a nice Rolls Royce
tum> for you, of course you remind your next door neighbor that his Chevy can
tum> kiss your rich ass. Likewise, don't expect Remorse members to actually
tum> care about you.

      This, i think, is a TOTALLY fucked stement from mr Tum. During this whole
      textfile, i have been on the same line as him, that remorse is the best,
      at least when it comes to newskool, group in the world.. but this.. this
      last lines are totally fucked! What's the MEANING of looking down on ppl
      that is not members of the one top group? I mean, look at Tum's example
      here.. about the money and shit.. Rich people looks down on the poor ones,
      and what is REALLY FUCKED is that the poor ones often is beeing ASHAMED
      of that they are poor! Like if they could do anything about it! They dont
      WANT to be poor, do they?! BUT!! They are worth just as much as they rich
      folks! And they deserves JUST AS MUCH RESPECT as the humans they are!
        I said once that "THE SCENE IS ALL ABOUT FRIENDSHIP, WHEN WE THE FRIEND-
      SHIP AND RESPECT DIES, THEN THE SCENE WILL DIE TOO!".. if that is what is
      happening now, then it is most tragic.. and i say that it's due to ppl
      thinking like Tum here, that kills it. If you think i'm completely wrong,
      tell me. but this is what i think about it, and i am free to have my
      opinion, just like you are totally free to have your.... to quote what
      Volaire said once "I dissaprove of what you say, but I will argue to my
      death for your right to say it".

      Like some weeks ago. A guy joined Efnet #ascii, and asked how to save ansi
      files with .asc in Aciddraw. After approximatly 5 seconds, there were
      like 10 people saying how stupid and lame he was. I mean, whats wrong with
      just ANSWERING his question? I dont think that TUM was even in the channel
      im just using his textfile to show what i mean!  Even you, that is so
      fukkin MEGA-3L333373 have been one of those lame little suckers, dont try
      to deny it. We have a HUGE ATTITUDE PROBLEM in the scene these days!

      "don't expect Remorse members to actually care about you." i relly hope
      that you are speaking for yourself only and not for the whole rmrs-posse!
      You must be submissive/humble and learn to respect people! It's not all
      about what group you're in, noo! Take a look at Sargon for example.. he's
      one helluva artist, and what was his group? HOMO!?! How good were they?
      no offense sargon, but they werent really that good. BUT! and here comes
      the important thing: I believe that SARGON had alot more FUN in HOMO than
  ... he would have had in REMORSE. You might consider me a jerk for this, but
  :   i say that HAVING FUN is what it's all about. isn't it?  // Dez of arcade
