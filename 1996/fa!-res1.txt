 |      Phuu... Getting back into the scene (Swedish) after about         |
 |      three years absence is not easy, let me tell ya! All my           |
 |      accounts, or most atleast (thanks Rille at Imagine! =] ),         |
 |      are gone. All the cool people I used to know have just            |
 |      vanished (except you Norad, you gotta be the grandpa' of the      |
 |      swedish scene!), and have been replaced by new fanatics           |
 |      trying to get respect in this crazy underworld! Well let me       |
 |      put it like this, it's nice to back on track! Many thanks to .    |
 |      ZeNdor for supporting me with modems etc!                     :. _|

 |      Well here you go, RESPECT (part 1), my third collection           |
 |      over all. This collection I'd like dedicate to my fellow          |
 |      ascii artist working day and night to support the scene with      |
 |      in most cases very nice ascii stuff!                              |
 |      The work in this collection is based on pUNK!'s 'mOSt             |
 |      rEspEctEd aSCII-aRTISTZ 03' (probably not the latest release      |
 |      but I havn't got a hold of any newer one.. so I guess this        |
 |      one will do). It's a list of the best in the ascii scene, so      |
 |      I decided on creating some Artist logos for those guys. This      |
 |      time (Part 1) I only had time to do the top 20 artists, but       |
 |_     look out for further RESPECT parts soon to be released.           |

 |      For those who care, I'm working on a Rating System for ascii      |
 |      artists and groups. I been looking through a couple of            |
 |      collection marking them with a 'grade' ranging from 0-100%.       |
 |      By adding all the markings from an artist's collections           |
 |      (s)he'll get an average rating which will be compared to          |
 |      other artists ratings. Finally I can put em' all together in      |
 |      a list showing who really is the best! To make this possible      |
 |      I need YOUR help! The only thing I want you to do is get in       |
 |      touch with me 'Nebraska' in the Swedish scene, and Nebraska_      |
 |      on IRC (euroside), and send me all your collections so that       |
 |      I can rate them. The ratings will be released monthly, with       |
 |      one chart 'OverAll' and one for 'LastMonth', starting as    .     |
 |      soon as possible.                                            : . _|

 |      I'm also thinking about releasing a GUIDE-MAG, where info on      |
 |      the ascii scene etc will be presented (including the rating       |
 |      stuff I just talked about...). Yet again I need your help,        |
 |   .  to come up with a cool name for the mag. I was thinking           |
 |      about 'SCENE' but if I remember correctly that name has           |
 |  :   already been used and put to sleep, right? I also will need       |
 |  .   a couple of co-pilots that'll help me collect material for        |

 |      What the hell has happend to the Amiga scene?? Ok the Amiga       |
 |      is dead, physically, but the spirit should still keep people      |
 |      attached to what has been our affection for a long time.          |
 |      Well it seems like more and more people are leaving for the       |
 |      fast growing Pc scene, too bad, that scene'll never be the        |
 |      same as the Amiga scene was. It's just a matter of who has    :   |
 |      the most money to spend on his (her??) computer, to beat the   .  |
 |      rest of the kids by uploading those 100+ meg releases. =(       :_|
