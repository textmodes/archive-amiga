I am just visiting my friend Mogue/Arclite as he confronts me with the question:
"Why the heck, Sebastian, are you a member of Serial Ascii?" So far i never heard
of a group with this name. Furthermore i never joined such a group. Also, i know
so from Mogue, too, Tango, who is also listed in Serial Ascii's memberlist, is
*no* member of this group.

This seems to me as if there is a new group that is not satisfied with ripping
other artist's styles and skills, furthermore they put the names of two well
known ascii scene artists in their memberlist, just for the sake of it.

Please leave me in the future, if you guys will have any, out of your member-
list!
