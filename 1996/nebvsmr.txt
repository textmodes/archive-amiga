          This is actually real pathetic, why even spending time
          on messing with you, Mark Ryder, who are you anyway...
          I just got so pissed off so I had to write some stuff down!










        I HEARD YOU'VE BEEN TALKING SHIT TO OTHERS TOO PUNK. A REAL
        FUCKER HA? YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THE HELL YOUR TALKING ABOUT,
        YOU THOUGHT I WAS YET ANOTHER NEWCOMMER THAT YOU COULD FUCK
        OVER, SORRY DUDE, YOU'RE THE NEW BORN BABY HERE PAL.
        I'M FED UP WITH YOUR BULLSHIT. SOMETHING HAS TO BE DONE TO A
        PRICK LIKE YOU...
                                                        NeBraska





The following text written by NeBraska/SaveOurSouls is just my version of
what's going on between me (NeBraska) and Mark Ryder. The text is personal
and has nothing to do with our groups. There is no war between Mo'Soul and
SaveOurSouls, that I know of, or that I care of.
Remember.. NeB vs. mR! ...man on man...


Things started out the 21st of September 1996 when I released my latest
ascii production called 'Respect' (filename: fA!-Res1.Txt). It was my step
back into the ascii scene after about 2-3 years absence.


Before that I used to create ascii art along with the big names in the
business, you probably never heard about a couple of these guys in case you
weren't part of the Amiga/Ascii scene back in the beginning of 1990's.
Artists like 911, Danzig, Manta, Exocet, Karma, Desert, Sy-Klone, Splatt,
and Godhead were big names in the industry at that time. I do really respect
their work from back then, the so-called 'Oldschool' stuff was high quality
ascii that you could read without being mentally (and physically) disturbed.


Back to the story... My collection which only contained ascii-artist logos
for the best artists in the scene, top 20 artists accourding to Punk's
'Most Respected Artists #3'. Logos for the following people were included:
Mogue, H2o, Uman, Nup, Karma, Desoto, ShapeChanger, Danzig, Exocet, Tango,
Chrombacher, Treach, Stylez, Count0, 2Fast, Stezothehic, Skin, Crusader,
Gozz, and Fatal.  *NOTE* MARK RYDER WASNOT INCLUDED!


At that time I was working for my independent release-lable 'fiNE ARtS' as
you might have noticed by the 'fA!-' mark in the beginning of my colly's
filename. Anyway, the respons back then was.. 'Great Work!' 'I Like That!'
'Well You Could Have Done A Couple Of BoardStyling Logos To, But I Like Your
Style Man!' .. 'I Like YOUR style man.' This is MY style.. or styles rather
since if you look through my 'Respect Part 1' collection really good you can
find no less than 10+ diffrent styles all created by me, NeBraska. Ok the
process of creating a certain style takes research, were you might look at
other artists styles and add your own values of what's cool and what's not,
but no way I would rip off someones style as Mark Ryder later on will accuse
me of doing. Styles might look alike to a certain point, but it's all a
matter of personal judgement to say if it's a rip-off or not! I respect that
you, Mark Ryder might think my styles look like Danzigs, but running around
accusing me for something that I never did and calling me LAME a word YOU
never should take in YOUR mouth.. ha poor thing..


Everything was fine so far.. I was looking around to find a cool ascii group
to join.. and that's when I ran into Xcluziwe/sOS. He looked through my stuff
and welcomed me into the SaveOurSouls family. I was happy to join due to my
set of values I though many other good artists was working for that very
group. Now afterwards I have heard split ideas about how good sOS really is,
but it's looking really good to me sofar.. =)


We now step over a couple of days that are of no big deal for this story
atleast. We end up on the 26th of September. I'm doing my daily visit to
#AmiElite and #Ascii (a channel that has been on-off for quite some time now)
on irc (euroside). When I enter the #Ascii channel I 'get' a public message
from MarkRyder asking if I'm the NeBraska/fA! dude..
*NOTE* ...the following text is not typed in word-by-word as things were
said, since I forgot to save that neat little conversation. I've tried to
tell it back as I remember it, without adding anything to make my state-
ments look better than they were, nor his worse than they were.


[NeB]  Used to be..now I'm NeBraska/SaveOurSouls

[Mark] No wonder you wrote in your colly that you respect Danzig since you
       rip off his style.

[NeB]  First of all I didn't rip off Danzig's style, I do respect the
       dude, but not you!

[Mark] Haha you're a lameass rip-off, ha you fit good in sOS then..blabla..


... and he just kept on blaming me for rippin' off.. saying that I was a
loser who didn't know anything.. as at the same time I tried to get through
his (thick?) head that he had no business messing around 'cause when I was
working with my first ascii productions he was still playing around with his
dick (if he got one!) tryin' to figure out how it worked..
After a while a dude named Crusader/Mo'Soul steps in on MarkRyders' side with
cheap comments like..

'Yeah listen to MarkRyder, You're A rip-off!' (He probably never saw any of
my work.. who cares, let him live in his small little dream world..)

'Mark Ryder Rules!' (HAHAHHA Ass kissing or what.. get a life punk.. to bad
you can stand tall and protect the stuff you say, but to hide be hind Mark's
big mouth!)


As the conversation went along I told Mark that the stuff I've seen from him
wasn't to impressive.. And to me the entire thing seemed like he was jellows
that his art wasn't as appreaciated as mine.. too bad dude..


Comparisson between NeBraska's 'ripoff' style and Danzigs work...

To check for yourself.. The only Danzig Collections that I have ever layed
eyes at are.. -g'prunk.txt & -G'RLPSE.TXT.. those would be the only ones I
could have copied one (two? three? ten?) of my styles from (which I havn't)..
compare em' to my latest colly fA!-Res1.Txt.. You'll see for yourselfs!
*NOTE* 'Rippin Off' A Style Is Not To Create Another Readable Style Compared
To Your MangoJungo-HardToRead-Messy-NewSchool-Ascii Mark!


What can I say Mark, You've messed with the wrong guy this time.. Saw that
you've got banned from irc before.. well might happen again my 'friend'.
That's not all.. you'll see.. well these are not threats but warnings, keep
cool.. Have a coke and a smile and SHUT DA FUCK UP.. don't fuck up a scene
you never ever belonged in. People are working their butts off to keep the
scene alive, and we don't need your attitude to spend time, valuable time,
getting pissed at..


To keep the record straight...
1. I have no problem with Mo'Soul as a group, I respect some of their artists
   like Vinzi/Mo'Soul etc..
2. I want no probbs for my fellows in SaveOurSouls, since this text was
   written on my own initative. They have nothing to do with it!
3. This text was written real fast, that's the reason for all the
   misspellings etc. =)
