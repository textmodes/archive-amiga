                                  . PAST .

   it is long time since i arrived to that strange planet called SCENE...
                                  2 YEARS.
                                2 long YEARS.
            it's time, which i advanetaged GOOD - in my opinion.
                    i met there many other mates like me.
           old ones and young ones (called sometimes 'BEGINNERS').
                  i did a lot of bigger or smaller things.
                  IT'S NOT MATTER how big those things was.
                            so what's the matter?
                          the IMPORTANT is an IDEA.
                         IDEA.  what a SIMPLE word!
       IDEA is a THING, which KEEP the inhabitians of the SCENE ALIVE.
                        they call themself 'SCENERS'.
                   they are proud of their 'NATIONALITY'.
                to be sure, 'NATIONALITY' is rather BAD word.
                      do YOU remember OLD MOTHER-EARTH?
                               i hope YOU do.
                                   EARTH.
               Nowadays EARTH means PAIN, WARS, CRY and HATE.
                 that's why the 'NATIONALITY' is a BAD word.
                    on EARTH, SCENERS was NORMAL people.
  on EARTH, NORMAL means BAD, KILLER...  and 1000 other definitions, which
                    we can reduce to ONE, only ONE word.
                                   HUMAN.
                             EARTH means HUMAN.
                             HUMAN means DEATH.
                        we - SCENERS - are DIFFERENT.
                    we ARE NOT aware of beeing DIFFERENT.
                             we ARE...  indeed.
                          we - the next generation.
                  are we BETTER than the rest of the world?
                              answer yourself!
                       we have a mission to complete.
                          it's name is FRIENDSHIP.
                        FRIENSHIP.  next simple word.
                           but how mich it means.
                  we unified nations, religions and races.
                     we are PROUD of our child - SCENE.
                                 FRIENDSHIP.
                   i also wanted to complete that mission.
                 i've been doing that during 2 last years...
            and i know, that there are next few years in future.
                     it's good we live in ANOTHER world.
                         we DO, what we want to DO.
                        not what THEY want we to DO.
                             we rule our world!
                            NOBODY can't stop it!
                            it's would be a sin.
                            it would be a murder.
                 only FUCKERS from EARTH are able to do it.
                       i'm sure they desire our DEATH.
                     our civilization is quite powerful.
                     but there are the ways to KILL us.
                       and THEY are looking for them.
                            we have to be STRONG.
                               we are STRONG.
                      but i'm asking YOU now: how long?
          HOW long we are able to be as STRONG as we are actually?

                                 . PRESENT .

   it is long time since i arrived to that strange planet called SCENE...
                        a lot of thing have changed.
            our SCENE isn't as beautiful as it was few yars ago.
                             THEY arrived here!
                    and THEY started destroing our order!
                  THEY took with them THEIR cheap products.
             THEY also took something else, something invisible.
                             HATE, EVIL, DEATH.
                           i want YOU to WAKE UP!
                                WAKE UP NOW!
                                 LOOK ABOUT!
                                we are DYING!
                  it's very slow, sad and sorrowful DEATH.
                   we accept it. and we don't do anything!
         it's strange, but we accept it, indeed.  fortunately there
        are the guys, who know and see what is going to be happened.
                       YOU don't know, what i mean...?
                               yes, YOU know.
                     BAD agents from EARTH are among US!
                    WATCH YOURSELF!  WATCH YOUR FRIENDS!
            fuckers from EARTH feel good, when THEY are killing.
                     REMEMBER, time is slipping away...

                                 . FUTURE .

                            who does know FUTURE?
                                   nodoby.
                   but everybody can see it in small part.
                              look at YOURSELF.
                         look at your neighbourhood.
 if they are happy and they need themselves each other, everything is good.
                                   but...
                     if they want to kill each other...
                           if they start the wars...
                          if they want to be ELITE...
                it means SCENERS forgive what FRIENDSHIP is.
                           what? are you ASHAMED?
                                  yes, YOU.
              think twice before calling yourself ELITE SCENER.
                    think twice before injuring anybody.
  deliberate if yoy are destroing our world like those FUCKERS form EARTH.
   our SCENE is small and unfortunately it's getting smaller and smaller.
                                    why?
                             i know the reasons:
     LAZINESS, out of IDEAS and leaving the SCENE for idiots from EARTH.
        THEY - EARTHIANS - offer often riches, money and false fame.
                       would YOU like to go with THEM?

                                    . . .

                                  - SCENE -

                               it is divided.
           i know the countries of AMIGAs, ATARIs, C64's and PCs.
  long, long time ago the pioneers arrived here to create new civilization.
             they founded the C64 kingdom and republic of ATARI.
                     kingdom was big, powerful and rich.
                        and so does repubic of ATARI.
              both counties had been fighting during few years.
                 but they fought by they minds, not by guns.
                 unfortunately, gold ages are past nowadays.
      after the very first pionieers, new colonists appeared on SCENE.
                       and they founded next kingdom.
                       it's name was empire of AMIGA.
 it was growing very fast, beacause many SCENERS was moving from C64 kingdom
                    and republic of ATARI to the empire.
                          old pioneers was jealous.
                  many good SCENERS left their fatherland.
 but the pioneers didn't want to start new war. they felt a power of empire.
                            and no war broke out.
             nowadays countries of C64 and ATARI are very small.
       only really good people deceided to stay in their fatherlands.
                 empire of AMIGA is still big and powerful.
                  it is a home for many fame personalities.
                                   but...
             after the years of glory, new worse times has gone.
                            empire has an enemy.
                         it's name's kingdom of PCs.
                    politic situation is very dangerous.
                   it seems new war is going to break out.
                 but diplomats try to soften the situation.
                          i belive they will do it.
                       i'm sure everything will be ok.
                                 WAR sucks.
                               we need PEACE.
                   many SCENERES moved to kingdom of PCs.
                                    WHY?
                                  ask them.
                             i don't know WHY...
       mayby they thought, that new country will be better for them...
                          or something like this...
                       what happened after the moving?
           i see they are the only NORMAL guys in their new home.
           almost all aborigines in kingdom of PCs are the IDIOTS.
                            we call them LAMERS.
                eh, eh, they even don't know what a LAMER is.
               fortunately there are also NORMAL inhabitians.
                   they try to change present situations.
          good luck guys. i know it is hard to change born lamers.
                              i know a medium.
         create a ghetto called QUAKE, DUKE NUKEM 3D or simply DOOM.
                   LAMERS moved there during several days.
                           everything will be ok.
                       SCENE don't need the PARASITES!
        sometimes, i think LAMERS are the work of fuckers from EARTH.
        i know, i know... LAMERS had to be invisible destroyers, who
                       arrived from EARTH to kill us!
                                    YES!
                                look at THEM!
                              what can YOU see?
             i see the creature, which is able only to CONSUME.
                               NOT to CREATE!
                        we DO NOT NEED the CONSUMERS!
         besides thoughtless CONSUMING, LAMERS kill the FRIENDSHIP.
     they don't understand FRIENDSHIP is the thing, which keep us ALIVE.
                        FRIENDSHIP has many meanings.
               but CONSUMERS don't know understand anything...
                         they are only CONSUMERS...
                 we - CREATORS are different. we are BETTER.
       BETTER than the rest of fuckers, selling their cheap products.
            how do you think, who does buy those cheap products?

          people say, he lives alone in mountains in the star base.
                 that star base is placed in the cold north.
                      he's one of the first pionieers.

                    AZZARO was known in past as CTP.
                        why did he change his handle?
                              nobody know why.
                people say he started to contact with ALIENS.
              his new handle comes from ALIENS' father-planet.
                      AZZARO means WODA PO GOLENIU. :-)
             WODA PO GOLENIU is an ALIENS' vodka-like drink. :-)

      next place. this time, we are in the capital town of kingdm of pc
                            it is also big town.
            i've been there and i think it is nice to live there.
    but... in my opinion inhabitans of this country are still a bit lame.
              it doen't mean that there don't live cool people!

                        GROO makes psychodelic music.
       he use the very latest samplers and other instruments produced
                              in our factories.
               those instruments guarantee high quality music.
                          and GROO is really GOOD.
    people say that GROO after moving to kingdom of PC's got totally mad.
           his madness does music instead of his real personality.
                 that's why music by groo is so psychodelic.

              at this moment we are looking at island of peace.
                  this place was not settled for long time.
      but few SCENERS discovered that this island is really good place
                               for star port.
         no mountains, no lakes, just sands, and sands, and sands...
             the island is so dry beacause of dry and cold wind.
             i have been there when i came to SCENE first time.
                          all newcomers land there.
                                      _

             he's a personality similar to SUPERNAO and to GROO.
   his music is sometimes slow and relaxing, sometimes it's totally crazy.
 people say he's going to compose the SCENE theme together with MORTIMER T.!
                              but PLOTKI suxx.

                       ZIG is a very productive coder.
                  the numer of ZIG's demos is still growth.
                        they have really cool climax.
       people say the future demos won't be as good as the old demos.
  probably ZIG will become a STANDARD coder, who makes the STANDARD demos.

    huh.   and what do you think about this file now?  as i said, people
    who  didn't  like  fantasy shouldn't watch this file.  in my opinion
       they aren't able to understand the whole climate of 'jounrey'.

    even i must say, that journey is very strange collection.  according
    to  me  it's rather short sf story, not an ascii collection.  but it
    doesn't mean, 'journey' is worse than other ascii kolliez.  i had an
        idea and i had to make this file.  i STRONGLY had to make it!

    for  all  guys, who don't undertand what is going on in this file, i
    say, that this is a tribute to all SCENERS, i REALLY DO RESPECT.  it
    is  also a tribute to sf writers and readers.  i love you pals!  the
                   logos are everything i can do for you!

    i  hope  you  like  the  form  of  'jounrey'.   i think it's my best
    collection.   style is quite normal and standard for me.  but design
    kicks  ass, doesn't it? feel the power of creation!  and remember we
                         are CREATORS not CONSUMERS!
