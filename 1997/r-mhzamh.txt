Shoot first, look at they head burst bleeding, don't wanna end no shit this
evening.  Believe me, we, bomb first when we ride, please, reconsider for u
die.  G's, and thug niggers on the rise.  Plan Plot Strategize, and

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In todays ascii news, the -EverContraversial- Megga Hertz has released another
collection under the alias Bugsy.  ASCII insiders are running wild trying to
re-arrange other artists release dates, in fear of a wipe-out in inner chart
movements.  Although noone knows the exact cause of the new album, resources
tell me a number of less fortunate artists have joined together in conspiracy
to assasinate the character of not only Megga Hertz, but of Remorse Ascii as
well.  Sargon, the alleged ringleader is furious of Megga's, excuse me, Bugsy's
verbal assault on Midnight Judge, Arlequin, and several other Serial artists.
Mjay, of Aphro Ascii fame is understandably shaken up by this release.
The question everybody wants to know is, why'd they get this Kingpin started?
Megga Hertz, rather Bugsy, was not available for comment, but released this
statement :

It's not about Serial or Remorse, it's about artists and bitches, power and
money, riders and punks -- which side are you on?

These fuckers is still fucking talking?  These fuckers is still breathin?
FUCKIN ROACHES!  Alright, this the raid on you fuckers..bombfirst..Bomb First!

    Some think I'm conceited and some think I'm big headed, but I think
              I'm the best; But you knew that already.

ABOUT THE GROUP.. .

Remorse Ascii is an independently owned, Multi-Style ASCII art group founded
aproximately four years ago by Necromancer, chief executive officer and form
er president Necro "Opus" Nite.  The group's artists are among the most popu
lar in the ascii art scene.

It's success as an independent ascii group is virtually unparalleled.  Since
it's inception, Remorse Ascii has release approximately 12 packages, account
ing for gross collection release in excess of 40 collections.  Although Rem-
orse's artist roster includes significant talent in the 'oldskool' ascii gen
re, it also releases newschool and colored ascii.

Oldschool is a style wherein a combination of slashes and dashes, as well as
underscores, is set to backgrounds.  Remorse Ascii's principal artists, most
notably Megga Hertz the Kingpin, Necromancer, and Hiro Protagonist have "cro
ssed over" from appearing regulary in the ascii packages, to noticeable appe
arances in major ansi groups packages as well.   The packs are an expression
of the popularity of various forms of ascii art.

Much of Remorse Ascii's art chronicle the observations and experiences of you
ng people, often describing situations which occur in their own lives.  These
observations and experiences represent a part of life in America that is non-
mainstream, and that the government, prior to the popularity of ascii, was ab
le to control, limit, and keep from the ansi scene.  The current appeal of th
is art to mainstream artists has caused great concern to the government, poli
ticians and others, looking to benefit from and capitalize on these events.

Just over four years ago, Remorse Ascii began admist curiosity, suspicion, and
even resentment.  We were looked at as outcasts by the art scene establistment.
What we brought to the table was a dream, an an insatiable entrepreuneurship
that the ascii artists all have.  Remorse Ascii is more than a group; it is a
family and a way of life.  With this Megga Hertz the Kingpin collection we share
with you the ingredients that made us succesful.  We hope that you share our en
thusiasm for what is yet to come.  Good viewing and good looking out!

   Thanks for picking up Megga Hertz, Activate my Hate!!!   A man with a
   trained eye may have noticed the presence of [mHz] has been scarce on
   internet relay chat(IRC) lately.  This is for a few reasons, the most
   powerful of which being that I have started tagging (piecing, specifi
   cally) again.   Piecing is a form of graffiti that takes a bit longer
   then your average throw up, or squigled line to show gang affilation.
   "Pieces" often entail multiple colored block letters, as well as high
   detailed backgrounds, with characters, or simple blends of color.
   The L.A.P.D. (Los Angeles Police Department) has put stiffer penalties
   for graffiti artists in place, mostly due to the recent outbreak of
   "taggers", or people who call themselves graffiti artists, but who's
   main purpose is to "get known" through the QUANTITY of their work, as
   opposed to a piecer, who thrives on quality.  I am nearing the age of
   18, when responsibilities multiply, as do fines and jail sentences, so
   the only "safe" place for a graf artist these days is inside his own
   house, style book, or the very rare legal wall.  If you set your mind
   in reverse, you may remember reading in Jagoff! Ascii Collection that
   my graf name is Raid.  Hopefully a few of my outlines will appear some
   time soon in either The Source, or Rap Pages, or if I'm lucky, both mags.
   The graffiti scene has changed alot since I un-officialy "left" it a
   few years back, but my passion for the art remains.  The best way to
   get me is to hit me up with e-mail, mhz@bigdog.clemson.edu.  Another
   major reason is that I have picked up my new system, four speakers,
   25 cd's, 2 tapes, and 100 Watts/Channel of MAD BASS and INSANE HIGHS.
   I've been consistently having people over to bump the system, and to
   listen to their cd's as they were meant to be heard;  People who don't
   seem to find IRC as entertaining as I used to.  I've also been finding
   boxes of old tapes, both hardcore Michael Jackson, Nice & Smooth, BBD,
   as well as an abundance of mix tapes put together by a 13 year-old
   D.J. Raid.  However, as upon viewing this colly, one will see that I
   have in no way lost my passion for ascii or the art scene.  Later, 

                                                      - RaidDeuce, 1997.

            stuff.

10:38pm 06-06-1997.  MEGGA HERTZ THE KINGPIN WAS CAUGHT IN A HAIL OF GUNFIRE
                     OUTSIDE OF LOS ANGELES' HARD ROCK CAFE.  THERE ARE CURR
                     ENTLY NO SUSPECTS FOR THIS VIOLENT SHOOTING.

11:42am 06-07-1997.  [xFx],  who was next to Megga Hertz at the time of the
                     shooting was reported to be of no help to police, answ
                     ering no questions as to a possible suspect.

07:21am 06-09-1997.  Megga Hertz the Kingpin is still in critical condition
                     at Los Angeles' Cedars-Sinai Hospital.   It is rumored
                     that [xFx] has been admitted as a visitor,  aiding mHz
                     in running his operation from the inside.

12:45am 06-10-1997.  A second attempt on Megga Hertz's life is headed off
                     at the pass when 4 masked gunmen are tackled, by KpT
                     just outside of mHz's room.

03:09pm 06-10-1997.  RaD Man visits Megga Hertz's room, and reports that
                     he appears to be in stable condition.

07:10pm 06-12-1997.  Doctors give mHz a 75% chance of living.

11:32pm 06-13-1997.  Megga Hertz the Kingpin flatlines of cardiac arrest
                     and lung failure caused by the gunshot wounds.

                                                                     
Before he died, Megga Hertz had a vision. He would live forever, and that his
blood would be part of mankind forever. And it was he, himself, alone who had
created this lineage, his own virtue. But oh, what a wicked world it was that
drove a man to sin.
