             Hello friends all over the world. Thank you all for
             supporting my ascii-collections. You're soon about
             to enter my fifth, but before you do, I would like
             to tell you a little something about various subjects.
    --------------------------------------------------------------------
             If you haven't noticed, I've changed the layout quite
             alot since last time. The characteristic 'real'-logo
             is history, and have stepped aside for a plain file_id.
             The name of the whole collection-serie have also been
             changed. I do hope to the better.
    --------------------------------------------------------------------
             Something else that's new, is that I've changed my
             ascci-handle from [<-«eal] to [c-REAL!]
    --------------------------------------------------------------------
             I've joined a group. After weeks of unpatient waiting
             and discussions, [pLEASURE] have drawed the longest
             straw. The reason why I choose [pLEASURE] was that they 
             gave me freedom to continue doing whatever I want to do,
             exept for the nessecary team-productions. With this, I
             would like to greet all [pLEASURE]-members around 
             the world; we'll keep'in touch.
    --------------------------------------------------------------------
             So, whatelse is new? Well, for the first time, I've
             made a collection containing pure & plain ascii, without
             [ctrl] + [shift]-letters. Hopefully, you'll find these
             more useful to your system, if you want to use them.
    --------------------------------------------------------------------
             Okay, that's about it. I do hope you find this colly
             as good as all the other, if not better. Let's get down
             to what you really longing for; my fifth ascii-collection
             called 'Plainful memories vol.1', and yes, there'll be
             a volume 2........
