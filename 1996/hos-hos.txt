                                Introduction 

As you might have already read, there is a new Hos-Price-List (c), and a very,
very keen system it is indeed, thought through by master-brain-sqausher Ramon
from the House of Style.Due to the shear briliance of Ramon (picture below)
this way of paying for solid art has become :
the new world standard.                 _ __|___ __  . _________ . _ \ : /

Today most of the aski-requests are made on :       \  __ _-_ __  /  °  \ .

splendid Hos-Price-List (c) (a.k.a. H.P.L)   rDm//___ __  _       l__l
could fail due to difficulties of the third
kind.And that is why i came with a solution to this problem.It's very simple
(because all briliant things must be simple) and it will be as the following
text will describe.


                                 Chapter One 

To solve the problem, the House of Style will start a bank on the Internet to
support all transactions in the aski bizz.This bank will be open 24h a day, and
can be used by any person who has an account and legal credit.When you need to
pay an artist because he did his job well, you simple visit the House of Savings
and transfer the amount of money that the artist should recieve calculated by
the H.P.L. (c) to his account.This will be arranged by the House of Savings safe
secure, and before you can say dog-doodoo.

The currency are HOS-credits.Each credit equals the ammount of one US Dollar,
taken on the first of July.So check a papper from that day, and see what your
local currency is worth in HOS-credits.There are no fluctuations in the currency.
We have decided to look at this day, and this day only because of reasons made
up by some well-paid scientists.
                                
Ofcourse should there be any problems you can allways ask TAX-blade.He is highly
skilled in loanings, and quick withdraws.His skills also reach heaven when it
comes to girl problems, but thats beside the point.

Should TAX-blade be occupied (which is likely with all those girl-problems), you
can always turn to another pair of helpers who will be there for you 24-7.
It's the dynamic due, raMONEY and red deMONEY.There is now question stupid
enough, and no problem too hard for these two.

                              Shooting Trouble 

You may have some questions already, concerning the information which is already
been given to you.I have taken the oppertunity to write down some truely common
problems, and answered them simply.


1. How to open an account.
Q. How do I open an account?
A. It's very simple (as i already mentioned) you make your contribution to the
House of Savings the old fashion way just for one last time.This means sending
money (US Dollar papper bills only) to the following adress:

House of Savings
P.O. Box 187
N.W.A 666 Holland

So for instance if you would send us a small amount of $50,- and your personal
information, we will arrange your account, and your personal agreement number
and serial number.These two combined give you access to your credits, so do NOT,
i repied do NOT lose these!You will then recieve an account with 45 HOS-credits
on it.The 5 credits you lost are to cover expenses made to open your account.

Because of our trustworthiness, many well-known aski groups like Epsilon Design,
Save our Souls, Arclite, Style and many more, have already opened there accounts
to serve you the best way possible.


2. How to transfer money to another account.
Q. How do I transfer money to another account?
A. Once again, the answer is simple.You simply ask the person his serial number
and use this number to transfer the money to.It's just like mailing snail to
some address, only now the address are just some numbers, it's really easy kids.


3. How to poison the city water supply.
Q. How do I poison the city water supply?
A. Just by driving up to your local water supplier and throwing in some poison
(same way Two-Face always does in those Batman cartoons).


4. How to recieve money and keep your credit good.
Q. How do I recieve money and keep my credit good?
A. By simply making some aski drawings, by blackmail, or keep sending us money.


5. Why are there no fluctuations in the Hos-credit.
Q. How come there are no fluctuations in the Hos-credit?
A. A good question (it could have been mine).The House of Style members have
decided that we will hold on to the currency-positions on the money-market,
like they were on the first of July.These values cannot be changed, and therefor
the deferences between different currencies can not shift (i already told you
this was going to be easy).


                         Chapter Two (final chapter) 

Hopefully all is clear to you, so you can send us tons of money and we will be
richer than that Bill Gates guy, so we can buy his company, totally bankrupt it,
buy an army to destroy any apparatus that uses electric energy and life the rest
of our lives in peace, knowing that there aren't any computers or what so ever
to keep us from screwing all the fine women on this planet.

Should there STILL be some doubts in your mind, be free to contact me at the
following address:

              Chapter Three (Chapter Two wasn't final haheha:) 

Now, for the more interesting bullshit part of this text-phile.It's about a
project set up by me, red demon.It will only be performed in Holland for the
coming 3 years, and will then probably be spread to other countries aswell by
guys who copy my ideas (so called rippers, check hos-hpl!.txt chapter 6.2;
a sample of the Lexiconical Part, if you do not know what a ripper is).

So my project contains of two seperate parts, but they blend together like hot
butter.Lets check part one, it's a great invention called the "stoned-trein".
In english that would be something like a stoned-train.From the outside this
experimental invention looks just like a "stoom-trein" (that steam-train in
english .. <sigh>) but instead of using normal wood and others shit to keep this
train running, 12 kilos of pure skunk gold cocktailed with hasj will be used to
keep you and the train on the right track.The big clouds of steam will be pumped
through the cabines (so there is no polution of the air) and people can get high
on this for the small ammount of $20 (or 20 HOS-credits ofcourse).On friday
nights, this train will be a Ganja-express riding from Amsterdam, to Apeldoorn,
to Germany (to pick up our major addict Ramon), and off to Scandanavia (to give
Mortimer a nice weekend).Ofcourse bitches will be supplied for free with each
tequila you buy (only $8 each).Sauna, bubblebath, bar, beach (plus some xtra
baywatch-bitches) are already included.This train will stay at Mortimer Mansion
for the weekend.At this place you can live your wildest fantasies (this will
cost you like $129.501 put you'll be high as hell, and already have given us all
your stinkin' cash so..)

We will head back to Amsterdam on Monday morning with the same train, only this
time relaxed live-music will be played by hip-hop legends like De La Soul and
all those guys who're down with HOS for too long.After you came 'round agian
from this nice little weekend, we will arrive at Amsterdam Amstel where a new
project of mine will be introduced.

As you might have noticed, there is a "snelstoomer" (a machine which steams your
clothes so the look all nice and cozy again) right in the middle of the entrance
hall (next to the pizza-hut cabine).This will be transformed to a "snel-stoner"
(i'm gonna stop tranlating all this crap, so you will start learning some Dutch)
So if you're still in for a little trip, just step inside and drop 3 dutch 5
gulden munten into the machine and you're on your way again.Inside this cabine,
you can put on a VR-headset, and go to the destination of your wish.
