     |   now .. i'll give keyzz for boooh!!                                |
     |                                                                     |
     |   Huoh. Tuossa oli semmosta vuodatusta että huhhuh. Ok, let's stick |
     |   to English for all you viewers. As you can recall (RECALL ARE YOU |
     |   HERE!?) I was just talking about our trip here.. huhu. Where was I|
     |   uurm.. Yes we got to the wonderful city of Turku in Finland and   |
     |   when we got to the boat-terminal our wanna(be)baco broke down..   |
     |   ..the wheel-lock or some shit. Well they towed us on the boat and |
     |   our booze-orientated trip to Stockholm/Sweden began. We started to|
     |   do our WiLD!-compo-entry, but we decided NOT to put it in the     |
     |   compo 'cause we were too buzy to get some moooooore boOOze. Hyh.  |
     |   sLiME told fOLAR that the WHOLE group will be thrown out if the   |
     |   orgaFUCKERnizers find out we have booze. Well well, I'll just have|
     |   to buy another ticket then? HMm.                                  |
     |                                                                     |
     |   And about that humongous greet-list sPEEDie wrote - we better meet|
     |   those dewds or we'll commit suicide. So we finally got to Sweden  |
     |   the nice swedish lukkoseppäz fixed our car and we got on our way. |
     |   After sitting in the car for ..  who knows how many hours we      |
     |   rushed thru the beautiful lake-scenery and got on another boat    |
     |   to Denmark. And so we came here - late - I couldn't get 4ch mod   |
     |   to the compo anymore 'cause the deadline was so early and the     |
     |   orgaNAZIfuckers didn't sTREEEEEEEETCH - byrocrazyyy. Huaah. Now   |
     |   dEMOLEE is shooting me typing with my camera. This is fun.. you   |
     |   could always buy our party-video. Just send us some booze or      |
     |   something. Eh. Whatever. Pussy said fOLAR. HUH. Well.. lotsa      |
     |   things happened during the trip and they can be seen in fuLL detail
     |   on the video. dEMOLEE even got a YOUNG girl. Nothing more to say  |
     |   about that? Hmm.                                                  |
     |                                                                     |
     |   BAFFLE just arrived to our bamboo-hasienda - let's make him TYPE  |
     |   something - poor him:                                             |
     |                                                                     |
     |   Hey! I am BAFFLE! Yeah... Sehr gut ja!! More beer! Like, cool,    |
     |   YEah---- .. Like.. Design yeah.. BUMBLE BEE LAND, the ABUSE BBS.  |
     |   We are all happy bumble bees in bumble bee land.. Drunken design  |
     |   yes... That is good.. Beer ist zehr gut ja! Cybergod is like,     |
     |   kinda like drunk and stuff.. YEah.. We will see him later, bohmee |
     |   said... I am a bum.. ,Ajungilak is my new handle.. NO WAY ...     |
     |   Like, BOHEME is so stupid, he spells my board-name BAFFLE BEE     |
     |   LAND, but it is for sure BUMBLE BEE LAND, at least last time I    |
     |   checked.. I think I have joined, like, 10 groups today.. FUCK!    |
     |   I can only remember groups like.. ABUSE of course.. Becaouse they |
     |   are giving me free beers, like everyone here in AARS.. And.. Like |
     |   DELIRIUM.. HEY! WHY is not mAZ not here?? I wonder why.. I have   |
     |   like the BEST table in the party plazzzze! SEHR GUT JA!! Let's    |
     |   move onto our table.. It's much cooler.. Let's go to MY table,    |
     |   with the BIG stereo!! =)                                          |
     |                                                                     |
     |   Hey-ho.. what the hell happened? We got thrown out of some danish |
     |   restaurant! HUhu.  Well, BAFFLE is way too drunk to even speak    |
     |   norwegian.                                                        |
     |                                                                     |
     |   No way! This is bafffle, and I ma like sure lke sober.. S8ire..ö  |
     |                                                                     |
     |   Very convincing, huh? fOLAR is hanging around with the norwegians |
     |   and stuff. Oh. That restaurant ruled until the bitchy .. eeeeer   |
     |   Bitch-granny took my beer-can.. too bad it was almost empty. Hah. |
     |                                                                     |
     |   dEMOLEE was so brave and didn't let the Bitch take his can..  oh, |
     |   we just aDORE him for that. Darn. Not that "dude from nORWAY" is  |
     |   breathing on my neck..   I wonder. And Neure is finishing his     |
     |   masterpiece.                                                      |
     |                                                                     |
     |   mOGUe is still missing and so is cG and .. eoooeer..fATAL? HMm..  |
     |   BAFFLE thought some dude in the restaurant was zINKO. It just some|
     |   other dude - but no fight took place. Phew.                       |
     |   BAFFLE is so eager to type, but as you've seen above - it makes no|
     |   sense..  let's give him another shot at it:                       |

     |                                                                     |
     |   BAFFLE: Like, I have been partying with Zinko a lot today, but    |
     |   when I come back to the restaurant with my ABUSE friends, he was  |
     |   _GONE_ ... And that suck, do you hear ZINKO, you fucking wanker?! |
     |   All the ABUSE guys (Hey, that's me!) wants me to stop writing,    |
     |   but they are ALL WANKERS!! Seriously, they are :)) Damn, we are   |
     |   getting thrown outta ALL the party plazes around here, at least I |
     |   am getting kicked out, even if I am kissing girls (No, not boys   |
     |   like Marwic/CRAZE and Nike/TRSI/CRAZE) but who carez.. The        |
     |   organizers warned us *4* times in the first hour when we arrived  |
     |   to turn down our stereo .. WANKERS! Like, we care.. Sitting in    |
     |   front of the big-screen is kinda cool.. FURY and the other guys,  |
     |   like SLIME and ZINKO and the others are here too.. Fuck, when we  |
     |   were at the dancing-place, I tought I was talking to ZINKO, but I |
     |   were talking to some DANISH LAMER instead?!! Fuck, that sucked.   |
     |   Lots of Dansish locals wanted to kick my ass. THEY SUCK MY DICK!! |
     |   Now BOHEME is coming "online":                                    |
     |                                                                     |
     |   fOLAR wants to write..  weird. He's so drunk.. who isn't? HMm..   |
     |   most of the ppl here. But this seems to be an unwritten law at    |
     |   parties. We're the ones too drunk.. argh. My fingers are.. numb.  |
     |   But where's zINKOoOOoOOoOOo and eCs and MArIoOooo..   damn.       |
     |                                                                     |
     |   dEMOLEE is taking close shots of BEER cans..  now that's way too  |
     |   interesting. fOLAR is learning some norwegian swear-words and     |
     |   other dirty-stuff - and he's HAVING FUN! He's trying to insult me |
     |   but he's way too drunk to pronounce anything. And now BAFFLE is   |
     |   whispering some suggestions to my ear. Dunno any norwegian though.|
     |   dEMOLEE wants to write "jotain"...  I wonder:                     |
     |                                                                     |

     |   At last a computer that works..   but has a german keyboard which |
     |   makes it almost impossible to use. Oh well..  we made some logos  |
     |   and then the disk it was on decided to die. We got all the crappy |
     |   introtext, but all the art was lost. Damn.                        |
     |                                                                     |
     |   We must send extra-special-vaganza-hyper-giga greets to the guy   |
     |   who owns this a1200, I wonder who he is..  hmm. Well, we'll thank |
     |   lORD of iMPULSe^aBSOLUTE - so there. Let's make a low-down of what|
     |   has happened:                                                     |
     |                                                                     |
     |   We have a4000/060/CyberVision/lotsashit but NO KEYBOARD!!! Uh oh. |
     |   And the a1200 we have is dead .. somehow. Oh well..    We've met  |
     |   a lot of cool ppl:                                                |
     |                                                                     |

     |   bAFFLE - as you might have noticed earlier in the text. He got    |
     |            kicked out of tp6 - for something we don't know.         |
     |   aRCANE - the other norwegian drunk (?)                            |

     |                                                                     |
     |   Still missing:                                                    |
     |                                                                     |

     |   meet 'em l8r..                                                    |
     |                                                                     |
     |   Ok, our official sTYLE-scout sPEED dEVIL just found the almighty  |
     |   cG of e^D for us. Now let's give HIm the keyboardddd:             |
     |                                                                     |
     |   Moi! Just came back from the bowling hall.. and that little brat  |
     |   (No names) drags me over here. Just to meet some stupid finns :)  |
     |   Well, I guess worse thingss can happen, such as being raped by    |
     |   Santa. (Which btw isn't fun at all, it hurts like hell. Vietcong  |
     |   tried to win some "negerpigor" but he didn't succeed. I guess     |
     |   negros dislikes charlie (vc, chinese, etc..) Uhm.. This party     |
     |   sucks, so yesterday, I had a taste of the wonderfull nightlife    |
     |   here in Aars. Uhm..  ok, 5 girls and 25 local steroid-pumped guys |
     |   Which resulted in me getting threatened a couple of times. Since  |
     |   I'm on medication, I shouldn't drink at all. When I do, I get     |
     |   somewhat aggressive. Well, fortunately, Mario and Recall calmed   |
     |   me down. Baffle got too drunk, and tried (and succeed) to be more |
     |   noisy than the music competition. That resulted in him getting    |
     |   kicked out of the party. At noon the next day, I found him sleep- |
     |   ing in the cafeteria. He was still drunk. I think he's sobered up |
     |   by now. He thinks he's sick, but I'd sure as hell bet my money on |
     |   a hangover. Fatal's pissed cause he couldn't buy any booze on the |
     |   boat over, cause it was a swedish one. I've got 2 words for ya    |
     |   Thomas: GROW UP! BwahHAhahahAh you little brat. Perkele, I've got |
     |   ugly finns breathing up my neck. I get turned on, have to go and  |
     |   do some serious wanking..  I (MIGHT) 'LL BE BAKK.                 |
     |                                                                     |
     |   Those wise words came from the folar's-beer-drinker-numero-uno cG.|
     |   Now we're still missing fATAL and cRb. Damn.. and tRIVIAL with    |
     |   his bamboo-stickah. And fURy should visit our bamboo-hasienda too!|
     |                                                                     |
     |   All these pc-nerds are either installing Win95 and stuff OR       |
     |   watching sick porn-pics. They're completely fascinated by these   |
     |   computers. I wonder.                                              |
     |                                                                     |
     |   Peeri is talking fluent English to some hairy dude who's helping  |
     |   him with ShapeShifter stuff. Peeri is so good in making lotsa     |
     |   friends by just babbling along.                                   |
     |                                                                     |
     |   I wonder where kENT get's his modules.. they're *uhm*             |
     |                                                                     |
     |   Now we found AdON/oMA! and he'll do the bamboo-thang also. We're  |
     |   all bamboo these days.                                            |
     |                                                                     |
     |   And what better than mOGUe on da keyzzzzZZZZZZZz next:            |
     |                                                                     |
     |   ever taste a german holsten pilsener ( 4,9 Vol) ????              |
     |   (given to me by adon (of the FUCKING organisation of mighthungry  |
     |   asciiartists) btw: im not bamboo.                                 |
     |                                                                     |
     |   now it is AdON at the keys of this computer i don't know... and i |
     |   simply don't know what to write - but i felt like writing some    |
     |   and n0w i can't stop... The organizers in here suck.. they        |
     |   threatened us about 5 or 6 times to throw us out.. so they simply |
     |   SUCK! and full stop...                                            |
     |                                                                     |
     |   bOhEmE here..  dunno if there's a war coming up between oMA and   |
     |   aRCLiTE or are AdON and mOGUe way too drunk. Or is it a war       |
     |   between mOGUe and fATAL!? And where is he btw??? And cHROMBACHER, |
     |   we wanna meet youuuuuuuu!! :)                                     |
     |                                                                     |
     |   mOGUe wants to greet eXOCEt and u-MAn..   and who doesn't. Too bad|
     |   you're not here!! :(                                              |
     |                                                                     |
     |   I guess hAUSFRAu is way too drunk to do any ascii for our massive |
     |   hit-live-colllllllllllllectiooon. fOLAR poured some alcohol on    |
     |   the floor - iDiOOOOOOOOT :))                                      |
     |                                                                     |

     |   rADAVI, fURY, sCREEM and rECALL are still missing - I guess I'll  |
     |   see you some other time - some other place.                       |
     |                                                                     |
     |   You'll see some weird stuff by our swedish fellows down there.    |
     |   I guess it's all about xCz and stuff..  we don't know.            |
     |                                                                     |
     |   dEMOLEE wants to contribute some more:                            |
     |                                                                     |
     |   muhaha.. it's now about seven 'o clock in the morning, and we are |
     |   drinking raw 60% booze (stroh, or something similair..) with fOLAR|
     |   who's going to throw up any minute now :). . hehehe, well as we   |
     |   said earlier we might be spending the next week here in Denmark :)|
     |                                                                     |
     |   bOhEmE is back and fOLAR is going to get some sleep.. AdON is still
     |   among us and smoking some..  some, some..  mild french cigarettes |
     |   and caughing like hell - or was that my imagination?              |
     |                                                                     |
     |   My video-camera is still in one piece - so I can rest in peace..  |
     |   we'll be selling this video likes hot cakes in Finland and maybe  |
     |   elsewhere. Where else can you get a video of all these ascii-dudes|
     |   sitting next to each other (and see us drunk - actually you can   |
     |   see that at any party:).                                          |
     |                                                                     |
     |   Darn..  another hangover is taking control over me. I'm all alone |
     |   staring at this 17" monitor and typing.. just typing and doing    |
     |   some dirty desig<\>s. I guess dEMOLEE went to buy another cd-rom. |
     |                                                                     |
     |   I knew it, I knew it!! Now he's the hacker-posse at mos eisley..  |
     |   he has two cd-roms full of hpa-shit (for educational purposes     |
     |   only:)                                                            |
     |                                                                     |
     |   gRENDEL of bYTErAPERS was in a groovy condition - as always :)    |
     |   The HiRMU-party-boozing-group seemed a bit tired'n'hangoverish.   |
     |                                                                     |
     |   The HUGE question is still our wanna(be)baco!!! WHERE IS IT!? And |
     |   Kent och Nette..  darn darn darn. I bet they're gonna show up here|
     |   like.. eeer, when the organizers have put us to work - cleaning   |
     |   places or something.                                              |
     |                                                                     |
     |   Ok, dEMOLEE on the keys now.. It's now ten o'clock local time..   |
     |   I and bOhEmE just played  X-tREME racing, till we got too bored   |
     |   with it .. fOLAR is under the table as is almost every other ppl  |
     |   here, but I decided to booze all the rest of my ten (10) 5.2%     |
     |   Lapin Kulta's huhh.. I think I have a hell of a travel back home  |
     |   If we ever get there ;).. Our car is still missing.. And has been |
     |   about 30 hours now :).. . Or maybe more, haven't been counting, I |
     |   bought two cdroms (100DK each) from a table near us, called:      |
     |   'THE BLACK PHILES ONE' and "THE BLACK PHILES TWO' isn't that inte-|
     |   resting or what? ;).. Ok, bOhEmE is back from somewhere.. let him |
     |   talk, he's a better talker than me ;)                             |
     |                                                                     |
     |   DARN FUCK DARN! HUh.. so much for "a better talker" :) - just when|
     |   I'm ready to EAT something they've ran out of hot dogs at the cafe|
     |   and the danish blond saleswoman didn't know a lot..  or then she  |
     |   didn't understand me mumbling with this hangover. I wish I had    |
     |   beer 'cause I only have like Bailey's Irish Cream liqour and      |
     |   that isn't exactly what I require. DAMN DAMN DAMN..  I'm hungry.  |
     |   I wonder where all the cool ppl disappeared - under the tables or |
     |   did they already leave? Hmm.. leaving - a nice thought. The tables|
     |   surrounding us are pretty empty. gRENDEL is still on his tour.    |
     |   I saw some weird dude with a suite and a cup of coffee. He gave   |
     |   me weird looks - maybe he's the local hitman or some other like   |
     |   a prospect for bANDITOS/hELL'S aNGELS.. you never know in these   |
     |   parts of Europe? I'll go and check if those hot dogs have arrived |
     |   .. the new ones - fresh - for sure.  HUuh. dEMOLEE can continue   |
     |   on this subject:                                                  |
     |                                                                     |
     |   Hehe, poor bOhEmE, I have seen those poor hotdogs.. ;), It's this |
     |   one SAM-SÄMPYLÄ (Finnish ppl know what I mean) that has been      |
     |   thrilled with a pathetic little hole, and they're taking about    |
     |   15 DK's for each.. Humm, I think I better wake fOLAR up now, so   |
     |   this colly doesn't turn too bored (already has?!?).. Ok fOLAR on  |
     |   da muthafukkin' A1200-TOWER external keyboard now (if he wakes up)|
     |                                                                     |
     |   Pah. He's too fucked up to type anything..                        |
     |                                                                     |
     |   bOhEmE reports:                                                   |
     |                                                                     |
     |   Darn. Those hot dogs were still on their way and I had to buy some|
     |   spaghetti. Wowow.. that that that..   saleslady wasn't that bad ! |
     |   Pretty cute and friendly..  maybe dEMOLEE should go and buy       |
     |   something :)                                                      |
     |                                                                     |
     |   That was some spaghetti - wet'n'all. The cafeteria at tp6 is one  |
     |   of the worst I've ever been to. Everything.. hmm.                 |
     |                                                                     |
     |   dEMOLEE is drunk again.. maybe I should take some of that Irish   |
     |   Cream after all - on the other hand I might get some spaghetti    |
     |   back up. Uh. dEMOLEE is mumbling about some funny incident.. let's|
     |   hear it:                                                          |
     |                                                                     |
     |   GOD DAMN, that toilet was busy for about one hour, my 'rakkula'   |
     |   was so filled up for good.. It was like hell, It's just good that |
     |   I met some friends of mine from the Finnish HIRMU-group :), I also|
     |   saw  bAFFLE  and  aRCANE.. bAFFLE was telling me something about  |
     |   drugs given to him, without his acknowledgement.. Well I believe  |
     |   him.. humm, fOLAR was just sleeping besides me,and now he has been|
     |   disappeared, without leaving a trace.. uhh, strange.. I have been |
     |   filming that fukken party video for about 45 minutes, so now it's |
     |   bOhEmE's turn to do all the camera work.. Altought I HAVE SEEN    |
     |   Renny Harlin and Geena Davis LIVE!.. We're listening to Beverly   |
     |   Hills Cop now.. Something to give us hope for Kent to return from |
     |   Germany, and save us all.. Ok bOhEmE is AGAIN pissed for my BS so |
     |   I'll give him the keyboard..                                      |
     |                                                                     |
     |   I just wanted to correct that we were listening to Axel F. Hmm..  |
     |   fOLAR is packing his stuff.. ooeer. Why? We don't seem to be going|
     |   anywhere - huh - we must be boring you with this talk about our   |
     |   trip back home, but we do want back home to celebrate the new     |
     |   year's eeeeeve. bLADE looks like he wants to write something:     |
     |                                                                     |
     |   Wheeh, Blade/bS! here, I'm "enjoying" this another copy/porno     |
     |   party with these other wackos. Amiga democompo was a big failure  |
     |   this time, along with other features here.. Big kisses to all     |
     |   my friends who weren't here, like blast/nrg, loop/abuse, saigon,  |
     |   ohwell, Hijack, g.o.d., nup, patrician, daeron, nose, kerberos,   |
     |   alien, other ppl I forgot (and will never read this crap). It's   |
     |   sunday noon now, still waiting for Kent and Nette - we have a cold|
     |   day and night ahead, boat leaves from Denmark tomorrow morning... |
     |   Other Finns are leaving just about now and all win95 losers are   |
     |   are backing their stuff, but we are in no hurry, listening to some|
     |   nice modules. Have to get some booze soon...
     |                                                                     |
     |   dEMOLEE/NVX bothering you again.. I think that I'm the only person|
     |   drunk at the moment. . It's now 11:20 local time, WE MUST FIND    |
     |   KENT or IRC, so we have something to do at this spare time of ours|
     |   I don't want to write more, at the moment.. Alrighty bye bye...   |
     |                                                                     |
     |   dEMOLEE will now concentrate on his beer-can..  animal-abuser-him?|
     |   Oh yes, it's me bOhEmE again. That spaghetti is twisting'n'turning|
     |   nicely in my stomach. And when I flush it with Coca-Cola it makes |
     |   it even more wild. Now some genius is pushing his ass to my nose. |
     |   fOLAR will do something this stripped keyboard:                   |
     |                                                                     |

     |   Our driver is still missing. He left early yesterday promising    |
     |   coming back afternoon. It's only one hour left of this party,     |
     |   no sign of our car - which would be handy getting back Finland.   |

     |   Now I (bOhEmE) have returned home and I'll just tell you some     |
     |   stuff. That thing up there actually happened..  our driver kENT   |
     |   had gotten too drunk on a little trip to Germany. Him and Nette   |
     |   our female main-organizer :) came a bit later than they were      |
     |   supposed to come. Oh well, all went fine anyhow.                  |
     |                                                                     | 
     |   The sunday-monday night we spent at some danish travel-home which |
     |   was pretty luxurious after sleeping on the floor.. and there were |
     |   comfy beds and even showers.                                      |
     |                                                                     |
     |   On the way back our car didn't break up which was pretty amazing. |
     |   And we didn't even drive off the road as lotsa Swedish cars had   |
     |   had done. Wow. bLADE got drunk like hell and we had fun just      |
     |   watching him. Altough we (me, fOLAR and dEMOLEE) drank something  |
     |   we thankfully kept it to the minimum to save ourselves for the New|
     |   Year's Eve. Neure got really drunk too and did lotsa weird stuff  |
     |   in our cabin like put his head in the garbage-can and yelled,     |
     |   threw money around and finally he didn't get out of the toilet    |
     |   HUhhh.. the characters are flying on the screen while I type this |
     |   but .. huh. Oh darn those organizers they typed my handle in the  | 
     |   gfx-compo like this: "BOHQMQ" - huh - Oh well, it was a pretty    |
     |   crappy pic anyhow :) Heh.. and I heard our (RRR & STYLE) intro was|
     |   shown or something. I wonder if it got ANY votes :)               |
     |                                                                     | 
     |   The Party was a good party after all.. maybe just because we met  |
     |   lotsa cool ppl. And we learned useful (?) drinking customs from   |
     |   the german dudes like mOGUe, AdON and hAUSFRAU:)                  |
     |                                                                     | 
     |   Now I'm just wondering how the hell will I celebrate the New      |
     |   Year's Eve 'cause we boozed the whole fucking trip to and from    |
     |   The Party and at The Party. My digestive-system (or something)    |
     |   feels a bit fucked up 'cause I didn't eat much the whole time.    |
     |   But that 30-bottle case of Carlsberg Øl might help.. ?            |
     |                                                                     |
     |   I wish good luck to fOLAR for tonight and.. oeer.. I bet I forgot |
     |   to type lotsa shit that happened, but most of it is on our party  |
     |   video which is over 90 minutes long! Gotta check it out :)        |
     |                                                                     |
     |   Happy New Year 1997 for everyone reading this. Party on..         |
