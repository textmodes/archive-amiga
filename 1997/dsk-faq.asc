.. one sunday morning Macaw suddenly realised that no one had released a DASK
ascii collection for some time, that could not be true(?). Therefore he began
to draw, or whatever he did... after his collection was  finished  he  walked
to the nearest drugdealer and bought some good weed and smoked his ass away..




this collection is ment to be a Question -> Answer thing, about DASK and its
relation to the real world.






q: are you guys acctually ..

a: frankly, my dear reader, none of us are acctually human. Long before  the
   mankind reached the earth we  were formed through a  large  distortion in
   the  galaxy. -- this made us capeable  of smoking more  pot than you will
   ever survive to see.. and  that's  why none of us, ever, could be seen in
   public (maybe heard, but what the heck?).




q: did you guys acctually attend at ..

a: heh, this is was not ment to be published, but yes, we DID attend to this
   party (more or less?!).
   The main reason for joining  the crowd, which was 40 small-fat-kids-with-
   greasy-hair,  was to celebrate  CYBER KIDS 50th birthday --  actually his
   birthday was not to be until  the saturday  after,  but  what the heck...
   We drank some beers smoked weed, talked to some christians (about  danish
   soccer?) and last we  finished a  FINE demonstration for the competition.
   -- We finished up as 13th in the overall competition, and was not able to
   change  the  decision no matter how much money we gave the organizers.
   A rather amusing event at this party was when I, Macaw,  Baloo <LGD97> and
   FIM <I2M> was trying to "rave-dance" to the demo called Second  Reality by
   Future Crew (old awesome demo..). Some of the greasy  people disliked  our
   way of having fun, so we were practically threathned that  if we  did  not
   behave  our  selfves,  we  would  be  thrown out (poor us??)... Instead we
   walked *ALL-THE-WAY* to a bar in Grenaa, which was dead or something.
   Enough about this halfway lame party.

a: yes, Comicon have been shut down by the local drug dealer, due to  serious
   drug debt. It is possible that COMICON might show up on the Internet, as a
   WWW page or TELNET site.. who knows what the times bring us..

a: yup, Cyber Kid's TELNET board have been officially promoted to WHQ.
   But unfortuneatly Cyber Kid was forced to  close, due  to some  heavy drug
   bills.


this was all for the Q->A department, on with the show...
