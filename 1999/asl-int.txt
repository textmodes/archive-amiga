           |      Perhaps the most troubling African conflict is the      
           |      one occurring in the Horn of Africa between neighboring
           |      countries Eritrea and Ethiopia. The area's current
           |      troubles may be traced to Italy's occupation of
           |      Ethiopia from 1936 to 1941. After Italy's eviction from
           |      the region by British troops and native partisans,
           |      Ethiopia regained its full independence, and Eritrea,
           |      which had been an Italian colony since the 1880s, was
           |      placed under British control. A decade later the U.K.
           |      withdrew, and Eritrea became a quasi-autonomous federal
           |      partner of Ethiopia.
           |                                                                 /

           |      In 1993, Eritrea seceded from Ethiopia, and relations
           |      between the two states remained solid, despite a number
          _|      of minor border disputes and economic controversies.
     - ---\|-     Even two years ago, President Clinton and other western
           |      leaders hailed the two nations' rulers as "a new breed
           |      of African statesmen ... intolerant of corruption and
           |      committed to free-market reforms" who are "beacons of
           |      hope for the beleaguered continent."
           |
           |      
           |      Such optimism, however, was unfounded. In 1997,
           |      relations began to deteriorate. Eritrea established a
           |      new currency and Ethiopia, citing economic necessity,
           |      insisted that Eretrians use only U.S. dollars in all
           |      cross-border trade. The implications of Ethiopia's
           |      trade restriction were particularly acute because
           |      Eritrea's economy is largely dependent on trade with
           |      landlocked Ethiopia.

             |    only the prelude in the war between the fraternal states,
             |    in which both mobilized half a million soldiers.  By the

             |    several other sections of the 1,000 Kilometers long
             |    border.
             |            Eritrean military were also inflicted heavy damage
             |    and casualties when trying to seize the regions of

             |            In the beginning of Febuary 1999 there was heavy
             |    fighting in the Badame region.  Only between the sixth and
             |    elleventh over 7000 eritrean soldiers were killed.  And
             |    the 26.  Ethiopia lauched a large counteroffensive trying
             |    to liberate the Badame triangle with success.  but tens of
             |    thousands were killed and more wounded.  the ethiopian
             |    army recaptured much terrain from Eritrea.  And the 40000
             |    man eritrean army was more or less wiped out and
             |    scattered.
             |            the 27.  Eritrea announces the UN security council
             |    that they accept the OAU framework, but they do not
             |    withdraw from Badame.  And a moth later they were inflicted
             |    heavy military damage when trying to regain large terri-
             |    tories in Badame.
             |
             |            After little militaric confrontation since late
         -- /|-   march, the area again exploded into violence in June.  The
            ¯|    eritrean casualties from 9.  of June to the 13.  were set
             |    to 21000 by the ethiopian government.  The eritrean
             |    offensive continued without success and during this month
             |    somewhere above 40000 soldiers were killed.
             |
             |            Now, both sides are rebuilding their armies at the
             |    fronts (including ocational border clashes) and the diplo-
             |    matic efforts of finding a peaceful solution are at maximum.
             |    But the western community are not as good represented as
             |    they should be. a shame.

 |   The New Republic, March 1, 1999
 |
 |
 |      When President Clinton took his historic twelve-day tour of Africa
 |    last year, he singled out tiny Eritrea and its larger neighbor
 |    Ethiopia as beacons of hope for the beleaguered continent. In
-|-/  Clinton's mind--and in the minds of others in the West like Oxfam
 |//  International and the World Bank--Eritrea's president, Isaias
 |    Afwerki, and Ethiopia's prime minister, Meles Zenawi, represented a
 |    new breed of African statesmen. Intolerant of corruption and
 |    committed to free-market reforms, Isaias and Meles were considered to
_|    be among the likely leaders of an African renaissance. But now, less
\|    than a year after this renaissance was heralded by President Clinton,
 |    the two men--and their impoverished countries--are at war.
 |.
 `|     The war on Africa's Horn may be the most dramatic and bloodiest
  |   chapter in the rapid disintegration of an alliance among a group of
  |   African leaders--commonly referred to as the "new leaders"--that once
  |   held much promise. In 1996, Isaias and Meles, along with Uganda's
  |   Yoweri Museveni and Rwanda's Paul Kagame (who, like Isaias and Meles,
  |   are former Marxist guerrillas), formed a bloc that was engaged in
  |   joint military campaigns from the Red Sea to the Atlantic Ocean.
  |   Eritrea, Ethiopia, and Uganda--with the help of $20 million in
  |   nonlethal aid from the United States--were all backing rebels in
  ·   Sudan against that country's radical Islamist government.
      Further south, Rwanda, Uganda, and Eritrea--and, later,
      Angola--joined forces in Zaire to help Laurent Kabila overthrow the
      corrupt postcolonial despot Mobutu Sese Seko.

 .      But, not long after Kabila seized power in May 1997, renaming Zaire
 |    the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the bloc of "new leaders" began
 |    to splinter. Rwanda and Uganda fell out with Kabila as he became more
 |    independent of his former patrons. By July 1998, the same countries
 |    that had helped bring down Mobutu began fighting again in the
 |    Democratic Republic of the Congo. They and other states are still
 |    waging war in Central Africa--only now Uganda and Rwanda are battling
 /    Angola, among other states.

        It is the Horn War, though, that most concerns Western observers.
      Ever since May and June 1998, when Eritrea and Ethiopia launched
      artillery attacks and air strikes against each other in a dispute
      over their 620-mile-long border, the United States has been working
      feverishly to head off a full-fledged conflict between the two
      countries. At first, the United States had some success, brokering a
 /    cease-fire. But attempts to secure a more lasting peace bogged down,
 |    and, on February 6, after months of escalating tensions, a full-scale
 |    war broke out. While Ethiopia's economy is eight times greater than
 |    Eritrea's, and its population is 17 times the size, the smaller
 |    country's stronger nationalist identity should make this fight a
 |    protracted one--one of potentially epic proportions. "It could become
 |    the biggest war ever in sub-Saharan Africa," frets one senior Defense
 |    Department official, "or at least since the South African Boer War"
 ·    at the turn of the century.

        Eritrea and Ethiopia are among Africa's poorest nations, and the
      irony of their war is that, ostensibly at least, both sides are
      fighting over nothing. The main flashpoint is a border region of
      hardscrabble terrain called Badame, which translates in the local
      language as "empty." After Eritrea seceded from Ethiopia in 1993,
      their common border was never clearly delineated. In recent years,
      many former Ethiopian guerrillas have moved into the Badame region to
      farm small plots of land, displacing Eritrean farmers who were
      already working the same plots. Finally, in July 1997, after a few
      heated but still bloodless incidents between the ex-guerrillas and
      the peasants, Isaias and Meles agreed to form a joint commission to
      draw the boundary.

        But, before an agreement could be reached, local Ethiopian
 .    authorities took matters into their own hands. Last May, Ethiopian
 |    militia in the Badame region began a new wave of expulsions of
 |    Eritrean peasants. When an Eritrean Army unit sought out the local
.\    militia to negotiate on behalf of the newly displaced Eritrean
|     peasants, the Ethiopian militia opened fire, leaving three Eritrean
|     officers and one soldier dead. Eritrea responded to the incident by
|     deploying troops in the Badame region and then, on May 12, by seizing
|-\   even more territory there and at two other areas along the border to
¦ |   the east. Eritrean officials privately admit that, for tactical
. |   reasons, some of the ground they then occupied went beyond the
  |   country's admittedly fuzzy borders and actually included Ethiopian
  !   terrain.

        The final irony of the war is that, if these two countries cannot
      coexist peacefully under the leadership of Isaias and Meles, it's
      doubtful that they ever will. Both Isaias and Meles are members of
 .    the Tigrinya ethnic group and speak the Tigrinya language--the only
      language common to both countries. The two men, and the respective
 :    guerrilla movements that now run each state, struggled together to
 |    depose the Soviet-backed regime of Mengistu Haile Mariam. Two years
 |    later, in 1993, Meles and Isaias agreed to Eritrea's secession from
_|    Ethiopia. Until blood was first drawn last May, Meles and Isaias long
\|    addressed each other, in letters and face-to-face meetings, as
 |    "comrade."
-|\\
 |      Indeed, Meles had been far more sympathetic to Eritrea than most
 /    other Ethiopians. While Isaias is genuinely popular across Eritrea,
      Meles is not well-liked in Ethiopia. Many Ethiopians, particularly
      members of the Amhara and Oromo ethnic groups, despise Meles, whose
      Tigrinyan ethnic group is a distinct minority in Ethiopia. Warns one
      Ethiopian diplomat: Eritrea will "never find an Ethiopian government
      as friendly to them as the present government." If Meles falls,
      things could actually get worse between the two countries.
  . 
  |     But it's hard to imagine anything much worse than the trench warfare
  |   that now rages on Africa's Horn. While many are tempted to compare
, |   the hostilities to other African conflicts, the Horn War is more
¾x|   reminiscent of the Iran-Iraq War or World War I. The likelihood of
%¾|   carnage and exhaustion of resources serves only to sap the hope that
 ^|   both Isaias and Meles once brought to the Horn. Not long ago,
  |   Africa's new leaders promised new beginnings. But all they do now is
  |   wage wars. Their beacons faded surprisingly fast.

           commonplace. Guns have poured into the region, and are

      !       Thousands   of   Ethiopian   troops   have  moved  into
          southwestern  Somalia,  sealing  off  a series of towns and
          villages, witnesses said yesterday.  The reported incursion
          provides fresh evidence of a new trouble spot in Ethiopia's
          border  war  with  Eritrea, which could further destabilize
          Somalia, a country without a central government since 1991.

              Ethiopian  troops  in  more than 100 pickup trucks with
          machine  guns mounted on them have rolled across the border
          in  the  past  few days into the Somali towns of Bulo Hawo,
      .   Dolow  and Luq in the Gedo region, the witnesses said.  The

,|    with  Somalia,  and  some  regional analysts link renewed fighting
¾|,   among  rival  clans  battling  for  control of the fertile central

¾|       Somalia  can ill afford new traumas.  The Somalis have suffered
~|    civil  war, famine, and economic hardship, as well as the collapse
 |^   of the country's government.
 !
         Both  Ethiopia  and  Eritrea  have poured soldiers, weapons and
      ammunition into Somalia in support of rival militia factions which
      they see as helping their own strategic aims.

         Within the past two weeks, with the help of Ethiopian forces, a
      Somali  faction  took  control  of the  central town of Baidoa - a
      strategic spot in the heart of Somalia's fertile sorghum belt. The
      loser  was  powerful warlord Hussein Mohamed Aideed, whose allies,
 .    with  backing  from  Eritrea, retaliated by capturing the southern
 .    port city of Kismayu a few days later.

  .   into Somalia  could spell  disaster for Somalia,  after its infra-

      that followed the government's collapse.
    
          "Ethiopia  and Eritrea have come to Somalia with heavy weapons
      and  too  many  guns," said Hassan Nur Hassan, governor of Jowhar,
      one  of the few stable towns in southern Somalia thanks to a peace
      deal  signed  three  years  ago between warring clans.  "It's very
      dangerous  because  they don't know our people.  It's our land and
      they can destroy everything."

       The deportations started in june 1998, a month after the eritrean
    invation of ethiopian territories.  Both sides have deported enemy
    citizens in a massive tempo.  In addition of war refugees there are
    aprox over 300000 deported civilians only in Ethiopia.  Some are
    expelled back to Eritrea, most are in put in camps inside the country.
    And Eritrea is no better.
       Estimated numbers of war refugees are a bit more that 380000 people
    by january/february 1999.  And since there have been heavy fighting at
    all fronts, the number have surely been increased.

       In a war like this, the victims are always the civilians.  Much of
    the international aid have been disturbed.  Also food production in the
    border areas is down.  And international organizations expects that a
    terrible famine lies ahead.  A famine in proportions as the tragic one
    in Angola.

           More than half  a million  soldiers are  now  involved in
           what has  been called  the world's  forgotten war,  which
           began as a border dispute in May, last year. The soldiers
           are fighting  on three  major fronts  along 620 miles  of
           border.

  Eritrean President Isayas Afewerki has claimed that Ethiopia is determined
  to march on Asmara and overthrow his government. "Reaching Asmara, that is
  the ultimate objective of any military operation. They cannot allow this
  country to live in peace, or this government to survive", Reuters reported
  the Eritrean president as saying. Isayas also claimed the Ethiopian
  government was too weak domestically to sign a ceasefire: "They have said
  it openly, it is either they survive or we survive ... They are scared of
  the consequences of peace."

  WFP on Tuesday warned that "an unusual shortage of rains across a wide area
  of the Horn of Africa could drastically affect the upcoming harvests and
  threaten millions of people with hunger in 1999." A statement said an
  extended dry spell with only scattered rains during May and June was likely
  to slash crop and livestock production, worsening an "already precarious
  food situation".

  "All the signs point to a potential crisis ... and we are trying to preempt
  that", WFP Information Officer Lindsey Davies told IRIN on Wednesday. In
  Ethiopia, for instance, the agency has received reports of people eating
  leaves and berries - 'famine foods' generally eaten much later in the
  'hungry season' - and of villages deserted as people left in search of
  food, Davies added.

          |      Just after the eritrean invasion of ethiopian territories
          |   the OAU presented the "Ougadougou comitee peace plan" wich
          |   was only a framework for how the conflict could be solved 
          |   peacefully. Ethiopia accepted it emidiately, but since it
          |   assumed that the borders should be set to "prior May 8", 
          |   Eritrea would no accept. 
      ,x¾x|      however after the heavy fighting February'99 Eritrea
    ,x¾%^%|   accepted the OAU framework, but did not withdraw.
, ,x¾%^   |    
¾x¾%^     |      in june/july 1999 the UN and OAU made a full complete
~^~       |   peace plan propsal. After a few revisals, Eritrea un-
          |   conditionally accepted the peace plan. But since it indicates
          |   presence of "a third party" in the conflict areas, Ethiopia are
          |   not so willing to accept. It makes them feel that they are
          |   a kind of punished for being invaded. So this "third document"
          |   seems to be the last barrier to peace. Eritrea wount accept
          |   without, Ethiopia wount with. But that's not the only
          |   problem. 
          |
          |      i strongly believe that the hesitation of Ethiopian signing
          |   is only caused by three factors:
          |                                     shock, betrayal and honour !
          |
          |   the last among the people and the nation, second is political

     If Ethiopian military objectives are to repulse outside aggresion
    and to recapture Ethiopian territory invaded by Eritrea, peace
    negotiations still remain possible.

     But if Ethiopian military objective is to capture the port of
    Assab in order to recover it's own access to the sea, we are
    certainly at the beginning of a long, costly and destructive war !!

           if this conflict is solved peacefully, there may still be a
       certain hope for the region. but if not, the civilian population
       will suffer in terrible proportions.

           the political relations will take long time to heal. as
       stated in the "so much for africa's new leaders" article, the
       Meles-govenment was the most pro-eritrea there was to be found.
       but after the betrayal from Issayas the two former "comrades"
       will have it dificould to cooperate.
           but Ethiopia strongly depends of the port of Assab.

           the largest problem, no matter any early solution
       or not, is the humanitarian catastrophy the WFT (World Food
       Program) is predicting. they are indicating a famine in proportions
       up to the tragedy existing in Angola. 

           Western Community: wAKE uP !! act before you are begged to act.
