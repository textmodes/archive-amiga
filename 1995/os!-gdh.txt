      `-----.
                  

               Yes, It`s time for yet another slag-off reply.
               I never thought that Gandhi would sink so
               low that he released a slag-txt.
               But, never underestimate slime, as they say.
               So, I`ll have to do something I`ve always
               thought of as childish behaviour.

               I`m still in shock. It`s amazing how people
               beleive things. I mean, if I don`t release this
               people will think that Gandhi is right (argh).

               So, get ready for the facts.

                                                              
                                                               `-----.
                                                               
                            17kb of truth                                        
                                                  
                                                        
                                                               
                                                               
  
                            
                  I mean, Gandhi even edits his own quotes:

          As in gdh-osux.txt:

I beleive your asc2 is ripped.
 ----( [·GaNdhi!·] )--------------------------------------------------

          In real life:
                                                              
your asc2 is ripped.
 ----( [·GaNdhi!·] )--------------------------------------------------



                         .-----------------------´

 
                                                               

And gandhi; why cant you get things straight?
I mean:



I started making ascii in the end of `92, calling round with my 2400. Made
a few private requests. So? My first colly came in -95 and that`s bcoz i
didn`t have a modem until the end of `94. HAd my 2400 `til 93.
At that time i had only experimented and i never even thought of releasing
anything. Then I joined Access and they wnated a colly...
 ----( vIETCONg )-----------------------------------------------------
____________________________________________________________________________


SHORT: "I'VE BEEN IN THE SCENE FOR ABOUT 6 YEARS AND BEING DOING ASCII FOR
        3 OF THEM, SINCE 1992. BUT I DIDN'T RELEASE ANYTHING UNTIL 1995 WHEN
        MY GROUP ACCESS LIKED ME TO DO IT FOR THEM"
                                                    
                                                               
---  Yeah, a few private requests. And it wasn`t the round style that 
     shapechanger used (great apologies for that mate. It was just an
     experimental style). It was a different style (ugly as hell, but 
     not just as ugly as gandhis). 

     And I`ve not been in the scene for 6 years? Where did you hear that?

     And I`ve never even MENTIONED you joining. You`re the one that`s
     keeping on droaning about us wanting you to join. The thought never
     even crossed our minds.
     The first time it was even mentioned was when YOU wrote:



                         `-----------------------.




sorry, I DONT WANT TO JOIN YOU. hahahaha..
 ----( [·GaNdhi!·] )--------------------------------------------------


Like, err? So? As if we cared.



                         .-----------------------´




And here we go again:

HOW COME VIET'S NEW STYLE LOOKS 1OO% LOOK-A-LIKE TO EVERY OTHER ARTISTS
STYLE? SOME KNOW THIS SINCE HE NEVER GET'S ANY RESPECT FROM THE MAJOR ARTIST,
GLAD SOME OF YOU HAVE NOTICED THIS.
HOW COME VIET CONG STARTED MOVING HIS RIPPED CHARS 'UP AND DOWN' (PUTTING AN
A 2 LINES OVER THE B, THE C TWO LINES UNDER THE C, ETC.) EXACTLY AFTER SOME
OTHER ARTIST HAD DONE IT ABOUT 2 WEEKS EARLIER? CAN'T YOU RIP SOMETHING MORE
CAREFUL VIET? SO I DON'T HAVE TO DO THIS TO YOU?

VIET'S NEW STYLE IS EXACLTY LOOK-ALIKE TO 40% OF OTHER ARTISTS COLLY'S IF YOU
TAKE AWAY THE  __/\__  AT THE TOP OF THEM. TRY FOR YOURSELF.




--- This is very interesting, since gandhi is 
    A) Talking absolute bullshit. Are you by any chance referring to:

         Like, that the logo isn`t totally horisontal?
         Is there a copyright on making logos that aren`t straight?


         And ofcourse the most entertaining example:
         B) That you`ve ripped off juan. Just take a look:

Juan:               Gandhi:

           Just check out the rest, and you`ll understand 
                  that the whole concept is the same.



            What`s the excuse this time?
            Juan ripped your style?
            Oh, I forgot, it was ofcourse
  
            "NOW WHAT I'VE DONE SINCE I'M NOT AN ARTIST"

            But, how come the was your fifth collection?
            Were the other ones 
                                "i think i can draw but i`ll 
            release a colly saying that i can`t draw so people 
            can`t take the piss outta me" - collys too?


 

            IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIMPPPPPREEEEEEEEESSSSSSIIIIIIVVVVVEEEEEEE




                         `-----------------------.




            And another little question i have. 
            Err, YOU can`t spell, so don`t correct me when you`re wrong.

            ex.

            "Oh, your fiancee? (nice spelling!)"

            --- Yes, It`s VERY nicely spelt.
                Maybe the minor fact is that you`ve only 
                had boyfriends, and the masculine spelling is
                "fiance" whilst the feminine is "fiancee"
                was a bit more than you could handle.
                Maybe, but then maybe not. Don`t care.



                         .-----------------------´



More, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, MORE!

OH, HE'S TWNETY (20 I GUESS?) IN A FEW MOUNTHS? PERHAPS IN 35 MOUNTHS OR SOME-
THING THEN? PROBABLY THIS AGE LOOKS ATTRACTIVE TO HIM SINCE HE'S 17 OR MAXIMUM
18, AS SOMEONE MENTIONED AT A BBS IN A PUBLIC MESSAGE. CONGRATULATIONS
VIET CONG! YOU'VE LIED WITH-OUT SUCCESS ANOTHER TIME. HOW MANY TIMES WILL YOU
KEEP ON TRYING?


--- Err, liar? How the hell can you say that I`m lying when you don`t know
    SHIT (on second thoughts, shit is all you know). I`m 19 right now.
    Im thenty in a FEW months. You`re the one trying to be witty with your
    untrue "facts".


                         `-----------------------.



WHY DOES HE   A L W A Y S  HAVE TO WRITE MESSAGES TO 'ALL' EVERY TIME HE
RELEASES SOMETHING?

--- Always? I`ve done it once or twice, but that was bcoz quite alot of
    people wanted me to let the know when it was finished, so I saved
    some time.


                         .-----------------------´



SCARED THAT NOONE WILL DOWNLOAD HIS SO CALLED 'ART' ?

--- Never had a problem with that.



                         `-----------------------.



WOULDN'T SUPRISE ME ATT IF NOONE DID.

--- Well, get suRprised.


                         .-----------------------´



(ON EVERY LAME LOCAL BOARD HE'S LOGGED INTO TOO!)

--- Calling Flashback, interchange, Undercover and the rest lame?
    Pah, you don`t know shit! (well, see above)



                         `-----------------------.



ALSO, HE DO BELIEVES THAT IT'S COOL TO BE 20, WITH HIS LAME COMMENTS.

--- Err, WHAT lame comments? I`ve said that I`m 20 soon. Is that lame?
    I never mentioned it beeing cool. You asked me how old I was, so
    I answered.


                         .-----------------------´



HE LIKES HIS (MADE-UP?) GIRLFRIEND
----////----
MY GIRLFRIEND WOULDN'T EVEN GET CLOSE TO MY KEYBOARD SINCE SHE
DONT EVEN KNOW I USE IT ONCE IN A WHILE TO WASTE TIME ON.

--- So, why doubt it? Why should I doubt you if you say that you
    have a girlfriend? Why do you doubt me?




                        `-------------------------.


vC! SELF TOLD ME HOW HE'D SPENT ALL THE TIME UNTIL 1995 WITH A 2K4, 
AND I DON'T CONCIDER ANYONE WITH AN 2K4 MODEM AS A SPECIAL SCENER?

--- Oh, so in order to be in the scene you have to be a trader?
    C`mon, Karma has a 2k4... Isn`t he in the scene? Get a clue!




                        .-------------------------´




DIDN'T SPOT HIM AT ANY MAJOR BBS UNTIL THEN ANYHOW.

--- That`s maybe `coz you`ve never called them!




                        `-------------------------.





     Let this be the end! Gandhi started this, and my reply
     ought to put an end to it. PLEASE don`t be so childish
     that you make another lame txt in which you reply to
     this letter. C`mon, your name IS gandhi, afterall.
     Even though you are lame, you don`t have to bve childish



                        .-------------------------´



BTW, NO, I DIDN'T JUST STARTED AS YOU COULD SEE ABOVE MUST MY FEW ARCHIVES
AND KNOWLEDGES PROOF THAT A LITTLE BIT ANYWAY. DON'T THINK A NEWBIE HAS GET
THE SAME SOURCES.

--- Ooh, and YOU are talking about pathetic English!
    I mean, It`s bullshit AND it`s badly spelt!
    I should know, I`m half Brittish!




                        .-----------------------´




    I really can`t be bothered with this, and I`m not gonna write 
    anything on behalf of the other oS! members, since I`m in a
    rush and I think they could write the same amount of text themselves.

    I can however say this:

    All members of Offspring! are quality ascii-artists.
    Kid Curry is no longer a member.
    Sal-1 is both SysOp for our EHQ AND an Ascii-artist in oS!.
