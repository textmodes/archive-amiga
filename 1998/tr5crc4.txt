>> The Raven by EAP



       Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered,
          weak and weary,
       Over many a quaint and curious volume of
          forgotten lore -
       While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there
          came a tapping,
       As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my
          chamber door.
       ''T is some visitor,' I muttered, 'tapping at my
          chamber door -
                                Only this and nothing more.'

       Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak
          December;
       And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost
          upon the floor
       Eagerly I wished the morrow; - vainly I had sought
          to borrow
       From my books surcease of sorrow - sorrow for the
       lost Lenore -
                                Nameless Here for evermore.

       And the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each
          purple curtain
       Thrilled me - filled me with fantastic terrors never
          felt before;
       So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I
          stood repeating,
       ''T is some visitor entreating entrance at my
          chamber door -
       Some late visitor entreating entrance at my
          chamber door; -
                                This it is and nothing more.'

       Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no
          longer,
       'Sir,' said I, 'or Madam, truly your forgiveness I
          implore;
       But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you
          came rapping,
       And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my
          chamber door,
       That I scarce was shure I heard you' - here I opened
          wide the door; -
                                Darkness there and nothing more.

       Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there
          wondering, fearing,
       Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared
          to dream before;
       But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness
          gave no token,
       And the only word there spoken was the wispered
          word, 'Lenore?'
       This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the
          word, 'Lenore!'
                                Merely this and nothing more.

       Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within
          me burning.
       Soon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than
          before.
       'Surely,' said I, 'Surely that is something at my
          window lattice;
       Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery
          explore -
       Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery
          explore; -
                                'T is the wind and nothing more!'

       Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a
          flirt and flutter,
       In there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days
          of yore;
       Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute
          stopped or stayed he;
       But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my
          chamber door -
                                Perched, and sat, and nothing more.

       Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into
          smiling,
       By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance
          it wore,
       'Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,' I
          said, 'art sure no craven,
       Ghastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from
          the Nightly shore -
       Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night's
          Plutonian shore!'
                                Quoth the Raven, 'Nevermore.'

       Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear
          discouse so plainly,
       Though its answer little meaning - little relevancy
          bore;
       For we cannot help agreeing that no living human
          being
       Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his
          chamber door -
       Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his
          chamber door,
                                With such name as 'Nevermore'.

       But the Raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust,
          spoke only
       That one word,as if his soul in that one word he
          did outpour.
       Nothing farther then he uttered - not a feather
          then he fluttered -
       Till I scarcely more than muttered, 'Other friends
          have flown before -
       On the morrow He will leave me, as my Hopes have
          flown before.'
                                Then the bird said, 'Nevermore.'

       Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly
          spoken,
       'Doubtless,' said I, 'what it utters is its only stock
          and store
       Caught from some unhappy master whom
          unmerciful Disaster
       Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one
          burden bore -
       Till the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden
          bore
                                Of '"Never - nevermore."'

       But the Raven still beguiling my sad fancy into
          smiling,
       Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird
          and bust and door;
       Then, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to
          linking
       Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird
          of yore -
       What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and
          ominous bird of yore
                                Meant in croaking 'Nevermore.'

       This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable
          expressing
       to the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my
          bosom's core;
       This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease
          reclining
       On the cushion's velvet lining that the lamp-light
          gloated o'er,
       But whose velvet-violet lining with the lamp-light
          gloating o'er,
                                She shall press, ah, nevermore!

       Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed
          from an unseen censer
       Swung by seraphim wose foot-falls tinkled on the
          tufted floor.
       'Wretch,' I cried, 'thy God hath lent thee - by
          these angels he hath sent thee
       Respite - respite and nepenthe from thy memories
          of Lenore;
       Quaff,oh, quaff this kind nepenthe and forget his
          lost Lenore!'
                                Quoth the Raven, 'Nevermore.'

       'Prophet!' said I, 'thing of evil - prophet still, if
          bird or devil! -
       Whether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed
          thee here ashore,
       Desolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land
          enchanted -
       On this home by Horror haunted - tell me truly, I
          implore -
       Is there - Is there balm in Gilead? - tell me - tell
          me, I implore!'
                                Quoth the Raven, 'Nevermore.'

       'Prophet' said I, 'thing of evil - prophet still, if
          bird or devil!
       By that Heaven that bends above us - by that God
          we both adore -
       Tell this soul with sorrow ladden if, within the
          distant Aidenn,
       It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels
          name Lenore.'
                                Quoth the Raven, 'Nevermore.'

       'Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!' I
          shriked, upstarting -
       'Get thee back into the tempest and the Night's
          Plutonian shore!
       Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul
          hath spoken!
       Leave my loneliness unbroken! - quit the bust
          above my door!
       Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy
          form from off my door!'
                                Quoth the Raven, 'Nevermore.'

       And the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, Still is
          sitting
       On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber
          door;
       And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that
          is dreaming,
       And the lamp-light o'er him streaming throws his
          shadow on the floor;
       And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating
          on the floor
                                Shall be lifted - nevermore!

   And the angel Israfel, whose
   heart-strings are a lute, and
   who has the sweetest voice
   of all God's creatures - KORAN


In heaven a spirit doth dwell
   `Whose heart-strings are a lute';
None sing so wildly well
As the angel Israfel,
And the giddy stars (so legends tell),
Ceasing their hymns, attend the spell
   Of his voice, all mute.

Tottering above
   In her highest noon,
   The enamoured moon
Blushes with love,
   While, to listen, the red levin
   (With the rapid Pleiads, even,
   Which were seven,)
   Pauses in heaven.

And they say (the starry choir
   And the other listening things)
That Israfeli's fire
   Is owing to that lyre
   By which he sits and sings -
The trembling living wire
   Of those unusual strings.

But the skies that angel trod,
   Where deep thoughts are a duty -
Where Love's a grown-up God -
   Where the Houri glances are
Imbued with all the beauty
Which we worship in a star.

Therefore, thou art not wrong,
   Israfeli, who despisest
An unimpassioned song;
To thee the laurels belong,
   Best bard, because the wisest!
Merrily live, and long!

The ecstasies above
   With thy burning measures suit -
Thy grief, thy joy, thy hate, thy love,
   With the fervour of thy lute -
   Well may the stars be mute!

Yes, Heaven is thine; but this
   Is a world sweets and sours;
   Our flowers are merely - flowers,
And the shadow of thy perfect bliss
   Is the sunshine of ours.

If I could dwell
Where Israfel
   Hath dwelt, and he where I,
He might not sing so wildly well
   A mortal melody,
While a bolder note than this might swell
   From my lyre within the sky.

>> The City in the Sea by EAP


Lo! Death has reared himself a throne
In a strange city lying alone
Far down within the dim West,
Where the good and the bad and the worst and
        the best
Have gone to their eternal rest.
There shrines and palaces and towers
(Time-eaten towers that tremble not!)
Resemble noting that is ours.
Around, by lifting winds forgot,
Resignedly beneath the sky
The melancholy waters lie.

No rays from the holy heaven come down
On the long night-time of that town;
But light from out the lurid sea
Streams up the turrets silently -
Gleams up the pinnacles far and free -
Up domes - up spires - up kingly halls -
Up fanes - up Babylon-like walls -
Up shadowy long-forgotten bowers
Of sculptured ivy and stone flowers -
Up many and many a marvelous shrine
Whose wreath괺 friezes intertwine
The viol, the violet and the vine.

Resignedly beneath the sky
The melancholy waters lie.

So blend the turrets and shadows there
That all seem pendulous in air,
While from a proud tower in the town
Death looks gigantically down.

There open fanes and gaping graves
Yawn level with the luminous waves;
But not the riches there that lie
In each idol's diamond eye -
Not the gaily-jewelled dead
Tempt the waters from their bed;
For no ripples curl, alas!
Along the wilderness of glass -
No swelling tell that the winds may be
Upon some far-off happier sea -
No heavings hint that winds have been
On seas less hideously serene.

But lo, a stir is in the air!
The wave - there is movement there!
As if the towers had thrust aside,
In slightly sinking, the dull tide -
As if their tops had feebly given
A void within the filmy Heaven.
The waves have now a redder glow -
The hours are breathing faint and low -
And when, amid no earthly moans,
Down, down that town shall settle hence,
Hell, rising from a thousand thrones,
Shall do it reverence.

>> Eldorado by EAP

Gaily bedight,
A gallant knight,
In sunshine and in shadow,
Had journeyed long,
Singing a song,
In search of Eldorado.

But he grew old-
This knight so bold-
And o'er his heart a shadow
Fell as he found
No spot of ground
That looked like Eldorado.

And, as his strengh
Failed him at length,
He met a pilgrim shadow-
"Shadow," said he,
"Where can it be-
This land of Eldorado?"

"Over the Mountains
Of the Moon,
Down the Valley of the Shadow,
Ride, boldly, ride,"
The shade replied,-
"If you seek for Eldorado."

>> A Dream Within a Dream by EAP

Take this kiss upon the brow!
And, in parting from you now,
Thus much let me avow -
You are not wrong, who deem
That my days have been a dream;
Yet if Hope has flown away
In a night, or in a day,
In a vision, or in none,
Is it therefore the less gone?
All that we see or seem
Is but a dream within a dream.

I stand amid the roar
Of a surf-tormented shore,
And I hold within my hand
Grains of the golden sand -
How few! yet how they creep
Through my fingers to the deep,
While I weep - while I weep!
O God! can I not grasp
Them with a tighter clasp?
O God! can I not save
One from the pitiless wave?
Is all that we see or seem
But a dream within a dream?
