                          slowly my brain got active again after a while
                        and directly thousand thoughts crash in my mind. i
                         thought and watched and cried. then i was taken
                                               to the radiohead concert.
                                       it was a rainy evening and nobody
                                                     could see my tears.

                   wind cools my sleeping eye
                      the rain hides my tears

                        nothing i could write

 i had so many thoughts.
 i created songs
 and poems in my mind
 for the hijackers, for the victims, for the helpers, for the survivors,
 for believers, for the families, for the pilots, for religous fanatics,
 for my wife, for the world and for my children.
                  but all went down the endless streaming river of live,
                                 away from me to those i wrote them for.
                                      so there is nothing left to say...
