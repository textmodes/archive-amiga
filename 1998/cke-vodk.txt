     As Cake slowly lowered the pibe to pass it on to his fellow tribe member,
Flower, he carefully opened another bottle of vodka. "Ahh" he moaned, "vodka,
can't live without it".

     "It's Wu-Tang motherfuck, mm yah, it's Wu-Tang motherfucker", it was Spice1
stereorag boosting away. Everybody at the party place, in the secret #klan area,
was totally stoned from Cakes "bag-pibe". This new invention from Cake, that
it was mushrooms that were to be smoked had been received with some sceptisism.
Acctually Flower didn't want to smoke the mushies at first, but after all little
competition he had to agree with the "bag-pibe" trick. Hmm, if i remeber it
correct, then we played "who has the biggest c*ck", and as usual it was Cake who
had taken the victory.

Even though Flower came in third (out of three ofcourse) he won our other belly-
button competition (yes, we were bored that evening). This competition was
Flowers favourit - we call it "rear-racer" (he sat on the toilet for 2 hours in
a row, while screaming "i just want my dear Kultura, and everything will be ok".

     Back on schedule. It was time for the ritual "dance-around", todays fool
were, ofcourse, Garflozzy, who ended up 4th in all competitions (eventhough
only three attended!). Maybe it is time for you to move on, "no hints, man,
but you just can't cope up with us anymore" Cake said in the telephone to Gar-
flozzy, "maybe you should come through with your true color, and go with the
rest to #remorse?" Cake continued.
      "Yo mang, were's my bird when i need her?" it came from the toilet, where
Flower was playing his bag-pibe. "Errr, shut up mahn!" Spice1 said angrily,
since he had no party-girls this evening. "I wanna go to tha town mahn, anyone
with me?" Spice1 shouted, <arghumpf> it came again from the toilet, "count me
in" Flower groaned. "Arh, shit now i HAVE to go with you" Cake said disapointed.
"Hey, dont be sorry, we'll go to that place you love so much, it is Cosmic Girl,
right?" Spice1 said, hoping that Cake would give him back that "bag-pibe" with
the funky effect. "heck! you might even meet that girl from the bus there.."
"oy, that's raihjt.. ill just back tha gear!" Cake replied with a foolish smile
on his face.

     Everybody went to the limousine, with their gear in their hands. Cake was
the last one to enter the car, he was still wearing his foolish smile. "hey,
look at him mang, he looks like a foool on drugs mang.." Flower shouted out of
the window while his long hippy hair was flying to meter behind the car. "heh,
heh, hehe" Spice1 was getting the abstinences from not doing glue the last 5
hours. "heh, let's kick Flower of the car manh! That would be totally wild!!".
"err, nobody toucjesss my assh" Flower replied to Spice1. "erh, maybe you should
take some of tha glue mang, it looks like you have a virus or something". "heh,
heh, heh" - the driver looked like he was anonyed by Spice1's laughter. "ill
grab the glue then.."

     The limo stopped outside "Gubbi-Gryden" - also known as the place to get
babes. Spice1 went totally crazy from seeing all the shemales there..

     And there she was, Cake's bus-ride shemale. But hey, what is wrong with the
picture.. She was kissing another girl "oh shjeith" Cake shouted, and went
straight over to them. "Hey howcome she is kissin' another shemale??" Cake said
while going beserk on some localfool.

     "Yo, mang, calm down.. you just need some of theese" said the localdrug-
dealer. "hmm, you look familiar to me.." Cake took a break, and tried to clear
his mind with some glue from Spice1's jacket. "hey mang, iii knowd whod youd

it came from the bushes were Spice1 was hiding (you can get killed in the #klan
district for puking i publicplaces!).
    Five minutes later Spice1 came back from the bushes with to partygirls
surounding him, "i hmm i dont feel like im on top of everything, let's go home".

    Now that was the very end of another partyadventure in the DASK-ghettos. Not
everything in here is fiction (ok, the competitions didnt take place, sorry!).
I will just stop here, before i start messing my new jeans again (yes, im
