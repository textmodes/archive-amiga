|   Alot of time has passed since I first got into this scene.             |
| Ten years to be precise. From the first glimpses of board adds,          |
| to doing them,  then enjoying ASCII-chart topping in the mid-nineties    |
| and finally stepping to the age of Internet, the DOD busts which led to  |
| the bust of one time Pro^Arts WHq's FTP-version, and now to the day,     |
| where we are enjoying this brief renessance of the scene,                .
| thanks to Sal-One's marwellous efforts.                                  |
:                                                                          |
ø   My boyhood dream was to draw game graphics. Spending time on the       |
: computer hasn't yet given me that, but like many ASCII-artists,          |
| I've found myself doing newmedia designing, which I never would          ø
| be doing without this scene background. I could've done much better      :
| in school without this hobby, but would've I?                            |
|                                                                          |

:/  One of the first things I remember doing on a computer, besides        |
| playing  games, was doing stupid pictures and animations with my A2000.  |
| But as a seven year old kid, it was mostly box headed kids getting       |
| stabbed. That was fun. Would propably still be. But that phase passed.   |
| My father used to get all our games from his collegue at work,           |
| then in the early nineteens we bought a supra 2400 modem..               |
| The BBS' we rang to were some local boards running on simple software,   |
| the first ones I remember only had some message areas. It was cool,      |
| but pretty useless for a ten year old kid. At the time I also started    |
| copying games from mates of mine. The cracktros on those were pretty fun,|
| and the massive scrollers soon won the heart of a little kid.            |
| At this point also the boards I called started having some demos online, |
| and I soon started viewing a lot of them. I also noticed that some of the|
| games I had copied, had text files in them advertising bulletingboards,  |
| one's that differed from the ones I was calling. These boards seemed to  |
| also have games on board, boasting with affiliation of some of the       |
| crackgroups I had bumped into while viewing the cracktros.               |
| Some of these adverts had the real numbers in them, so I called them up. |
| They had all sorts of trivias to sorten the new user out, and I really   |
| didn't quite succeed. But luckily I did get an account on one of them.   |
| So now I had an account on one of these boards. Sweet. The problem I     |
| instantly stumbled across was that I really didn't have any stuff to     |
| upload there. I managed to upload some crap there, and it all wasn't     |
| nuked so I had like 200kb of credits there. In the next coming weeks     |
| I got two other accounts, now trying to get some serious transfering     |
| done. That was a pretty bad attempt, as I always had to first check      |
| if the others had the file and then download it and then try to upload   |
| it, and hope I wouldn't get nuked. In the next months of                 |
| late '92 / early '93, I did get access on several "elite" BBS',          |
| and I even managed to get a 14.4k modem.                                 |

|   I really couldn't say that I was moving a lot of stuff, nor that I     |
| would've had much credits, so as I bumped into the magical world of      |
| ASCII-art. In '92 I tried to do some of my own. I got a few requests and |
| then figured out that SysOps like ASCII-artists so I did some            |
| collections, I guess the feeling of releasing your own stuff plus        |
| getting the crucial 3:1 credits for it on all the boards I was on was    |
| a somewhat good reason on doing stuff. The stuff was pretty lame,        |
| that one has to admit, and while life was good, I decided to change my    |
| style and handle in '94. Nup! came into life and I quite soon organized  |
| Pro^Arts to consist of the finnish ASCII'ers. <elv!s>, ZoMbiE,           |
| StEzOtEhIC, cOCO pOPS, hIJACK, zEUS, ·dual·.. damn, those were the days. |
| I was a member of a group called Depth in '93, (not to be confused with  |
| the norwegian group called Depth) which soon joined Fanatic, but as nUP! |
| I was pretty groupless but I soon teamed up with a bunch of groups       |
| like Mystic and Outlaws as for some uncomprehendable reason, they        |
| wanted to recruit ASCII-artists. I also traded a bit and got myself      |
| as a CoSysOp at some boards. Eastern Front and 187. The fun thing is,    .
| those boards also used to be ran by group leaders, which caused me to    |
| be a member of both DCS and Royal.                                       |

|   So I was also calling abroad, causing my parents to be totally fucked  |
| up with me. We once got this phonebill of 10 000 FIM which is equalent   |
| to 1600 euros. Sweet. Somehow I managed to convince my parents that if   |
| I would get a personal phoneline and start a BBS the problem would stop  |
| existing. Wrong. I set up a BBS, naming it after an ASCII I had found on |
| my disk. It's the oldest proof of my ASCII-work, done somewhere in the   |
| late '92. So now I had a BBS. Running with a 28.8 Well modem with it.    |
| What a piece of crap that was. I had some foreign users but they had     |
| major problems on connecting and only BiSCrøK & VeGAS from Outlaws       |
| gave me proper foreign support, so it was a bit slow and I did some      |
| calling my self. I never was a big card user, so eventually I got a too  |
| big phonebill and the board got closed.                                  |

|   Pro^Arts had grewn big, both member and boardwise, so it came as no    |
: surprise that a big falldown would follow. I think it all started when   |
| we had Lunatic Asylum as a WHq. Then somehow the SysOp, Hoffi, got this  .
| idea that I had leaked some information out how to log in to the BBS.    |
| That was totally false, but I couldn't prove it otherwise so we lost the |
| board. I think this and the fact that I quite selfishly ran the group    |
| caused the falldown and eventual forming of a group called Style, which  |
| then only consisted of finnish artists. So now I was independent.        |
| I released a few ASCII collections, first as independent and then        |
| visited groups like Honey-ascii div. and Whale, and as the last and the  |
| least, Grotesticle.                                                      |
|                                                                          |
|   At this time boards had to also have telnet nodes on them,             |
| and I found myself on the IRC chatting with old mates and getting new    |
| ones, and connecting to BBS' via telnet. I had had an ringdown Internet  |
| connection at home earlier, but I thought it wasn't working anymore but  |
| for my and my parents' surprise, we noticed we still were getting billed |
| for one, even though we hadn't been paying the bills for a year or so,   |
| so off I was at home sitting on IRC. Soon I was chatting with            |
| Terminal Silence and all those other weird chaps and as Terminal Silence |
| changed his name to Mark Ryder, he also formed a group called Mo' Soul,  |
| which was a great group with some amazing organizing stuff.              |
| We got like real letters home with newsfiles and stuff. I did a few      |
| collections, then being a lazyass and inspired by Marius started         :
| slapping fools :-) Mo' Soul fell because Mark Ryder had some financial   |
. difficulties and had to sell his Amiga,                                  |
| so off I was with the new dawn of Pro^Arts.                              |

| been influenced a lot by other people. People like Desert, Boomer,       |
| H2o, Rotox, Mazza, Mogue, Skin, GodHead, G.E.M., Amblin, Shapechanger,   |

|        And oh.. don't take that as my full personal respect list.        :
|            There's plenty more love where that came from :-)             |

|   As I said earlier I joined DCS at some point, and helped Haka on       |
| organizing the finnish division, which at that point consisted only of   |
| some door-coders and traders. I got a hold of a bunch of people and we   |
| started doing demos and stuff, eventually starting doing some proper     |
| pixeling myself. Blank of DCS changed his handle to Adam,                |
| Terminal Silence of Mo' Soul himself to Mark Ryder, so I changed my      |
| handle to 'b! at that point. Don't ask me why. I have no idea.           |
| We did some demostuff and got OK'd from Snuskis that we                  |
. can recruit people outside Finland. Then we released a few games even.   |
| That was fun, but we all knew the inevitable. The Amiga scene was dead.  |
| Dead as in the way we used to know it.                                   |
|                                                                          |
|   My mate Speedevil got me to do some ASCII requests for FTP-sites       |
| and eventually he asked me to draw a logo for Menace, a group he         |
| said was the number one Gameboy Color release group. GBC? I had seen     |
| Gameboy stuff on the boards earlier, but I never really had given it a   .
| thought. I studied it a bit, and alas, I was enchanted by the mear       |
| resemblance that the console, and the scene shared with the old Amiga    |
| days and soon started doing graphics for Capital, the biggest trainer    |
| group on Gameboy at the time. The console had alot of limits, but I      |
| considered them more like a challenge. Again meeting new people and      |
| finally moving DCS to the console era...                                 |
| This is the era I live now scenewise.                                    |
|                                                                          |
|                                                                          |
|   We still have ASCII around us. Just in different places.               |
| Sites, shells and as it has proven in the late 90's,                     |
| the ASCII-scene needs ASCIIs for it's own use.                           |
|                                                                          |

        | changed. Like the year for example.                      |
        | My man Mogue asked me to team up with Arclite.           |
        | I was honoured and after a short think-through I joined  |
        | the proud ranks of the greatest ASCII-group ever.        |
        |                                                          |
        | Happy new year!                                          |

|         who might come to enjoy similiar memories in the future.         |
