    Things like to continue and so
    I did it with this kind of new                  __
    collection, which should  be a                _/..\_
    WORLDRECORD, as no  one before               / \__/ \
    reached the magic  5ØØkbYTE as               \__\/__/
    I did with  this collection...    
                                      As you might have noticed,this
                                      ASCII-COLLECTION is da biggest
                                      one I ever released and I took
                                      me a lot of time and many wise
                                      words/pushes from   some of my
                                      friends... So I hope you enjoy
    this cool production and always
    remember... CHAOS AD ...
                                      
                                      Why this name, you may  guess?
                                      Well, I simply  enjoyed listen
                                      to the SEPULTURA-CD named ....

                                                 CHAOS AD

                                      And so I decided to do  a  new
                                      collection  and give  here the
                                      name... I  get also  pissed of
                                      all  these rave's and I justed
                                      listened  to some heavy-cd and
                                      Sepultura is a kind of CULT  4
                                      me... so I still listen to the
                                      hardcore-things, but sometimes
                                      it turns me on  to   through a
                                      heavy cd into my player...
