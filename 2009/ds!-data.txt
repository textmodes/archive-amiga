|  we have lounge areas with cozy sofas and arm chairs where you can         :

|  Having the party at a nightclub is something special. The greatest        |
|  difference from other small parties is that DATASTORM will feature a      |
|  proper bar with service-minded personnel that works as long as people     |
|  are awake and will serve thirsty party freax with an endless supply of    |

|  But a party is not just about drinking right? We also hired some cooks    |
|  that will deliver vegetarian and non-vegeterarian breakfast, dinner, and  |
|  supper on announced times. When the special meals are not served, barfood |
|  like pizza, hummousrolls, falafel and kebab can be ordered as long as the |
|  bar is open. Everything to a price that even the scener on a budget can   |
|  afford! Ofcourse you can also buy snacks, candy and tobacco at all times. |
|  And the coffee is free, so you don't fall asleep before your releases are |
|° finished in time for the competition!                     ÷          °    |

|  The mighty competition is being held at Saturday evening with the winners |
|  being presented after midnight..                           ÷          __ _|
|                                                                  °    \\_\\_
|  Stay tuned for the announcement of compo-prizes! °                        |
:÷            °                                                              |
|  The atmosphere when all competitors are present during the compo is       :
|  unbeatable. Therefore we do not allow remote entries which means that     |
|  atleast one of the authors of an entry must be present at the party.      |
|  However, we do allow (and even encourage!) snail mail entries in the      |
|_ Packdisk Open contest, see below for further details.          ÷          |
_//                      °                                                °  |
|  The procedure of handing in your competition entries is as follows:       |
|                                                   °                        |
|  * Place your entries on a physical storage media. For Amiga we accept     |
|    3.5" floppydisks and CF-cards. For C64 we accept 5.25" floppydisks.     |
|    For other formats we accept whatever media the particular backup unit   |
| ÷  is designed for (Flashcart/Floppys/CD's). Floppies are kept so keep a   :
|    backup! If you hand in expensive media (CF:s/Usb-sticks/Laserdiscs) be  |
:    sure to mark it up with your handle in order to get it back safely.. ÷  |
|  * Find yourself an application-form and fill it in with information  °    |
|°   about your release, specific routines for running it, what SID-chip     |
|    should be used etc. One paper / Entry!                         °        |
|  * Deliver 1+2 to the compo-staff in the control-booth and only to the __ _|
|    staff in the control-booth.      °                                 \\_\\_
|            ÷                                                             ° |
|  The deadline for handing in compo entries is preliminarily set between    |
|  15.00 and 18.00, Saturday evening. The voting procedure is similar to the |
|  one in use at LCP. In short, each entry is given a score from 1 (very bad)|
|  to 10 (excellent). Blank votes are also allowed, and are ignored when     |
|  calculating the average score. This means that entries that don't get     |
|  enough votes might be biased, so if an entry gets less than 10 votes it   |
| °will be excluded from the results (this is just to guarantee the fairness |
|_ of the compo, in practice it has never been a problem at LCP).            :
_//     ÷         °                                                          |
|  Voting is made on votedisks that will be handed out after the compo. Grab |
|  a disk and vote on your own computer, or use one of the public voting ÷   |
|  terminals. After the voting the disks are collected and the score is      |
|  automagically calculated. We reserve the right to reject lame attempts to |
|  manipulate the compo in a negative way (such as voting 1 for everyone __ _|
|  else, and 10 for yourself). °                                ÷       \\_\\_
|          °                         ÷                 °                     |
|  We reserve the right to merge compos if we don't get enough entries and   |
|  split compos if we get enough entries for new categories in addition to   |
|  those listed below.    ÷                                                  |
