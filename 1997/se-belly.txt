    TANGo  writing  a  few  words  here  on  the night before I leave for
    Finland.   The thought of meeting all these crazed, drugged and drunk
    Finnish  madmen is something that quite scares me but fuck knows what
    they  are going to make of me and my tongue when I arrive.  I guess I
    should  be  packing  a few things together and getting an early night
    but I really can't be fucked when I know that I have at least 2 hours
    in the morning (if I actually get up :)

    Does  anyone  else  think  that  Finnish  currency  looks like Disney
    Dollars or something?

    Does "Suomen Pankki Finlands Bank" mean "Walt Disney World"?

    Does "Viisikymmenta markkaa" mean "Only useable in Walt Disney Land"?

    And why does the man on the front of the Hundra mark note have really
    fucking mad dope trip hair?

    Oh well I guess it's time for a little sleep now and a weird journey
    to the land of no sporting heroes :)

     |   Uuh la la! ASSembly'97..   ehm. Getting MORE and MORE lamer  |
     |   every year. That's the song we sing here. Ehm. Last night    |
     |   was pretty cool anyhow. Outside that is..  oh, it's me       |
     |   bOhEmE typing here. So pSYKO ripped his pants. LAGERS showed |
     |   his ass around.. and later on pSYKO joined the mooning       |
     |   sessions. We're still waiting to see TANGo's hairy ass. sTZ  |
     |   promised to lick it anyhow. So what's new? zEUs joined back  |
     |   to sTYLE! Ehm. sTZ was boozing with the local denas - he sure|
     |   knows how to parrrrty. All these tROPIC aSCII -dudes are     |
     |   SMALL.. except for some fat bastard. Hih! TANGo and the rest |
     |   of the nVx-crew (cRASH!, zONE, mESON, sCHLOTT) are amazed    |
     |   of this fucked up land. Everything's so fucking expensive for|
     |   them. BAah.. my hangoverishhh mind doesn't work at all. We   |
     |   need beer for inspiration. Oh, rEPE's module got into the    |
     |   4channel-compo! sTYLE rules your puny ass. I'll let fOLAR    |
     |   type something 'cause my ..  FUCK!                           |
     |                                                                |
     |   Oh Damn.. Folar here! argh.. Very boring to type anything,   |
     |   bcoz we are pretty much sober. This sucks.. Tho' it's quite  |
     |   nice to see that Stz has a fucking great time :))) God damn  |
     |   i didn't find my "new" girlie last nite .. Damn rednex!!!!!  |
     |   Hey Tango .. Wanna write something .?? ..                    |
     |                                                                |
     |   not really because i am too fucking sober. despite psyko's   |
     |   promise to BOOZE LIKE HELLLLL all day the lightweight has    |
     |   disappeared up his own ass and keeps showing us all his balls|
     |   i think that stezo is in love with his balls anyway but not  |
     |   the rest of us haha. all the style guys are actually madder  |
     |   than i thought they would be but i think that every fucking  |
     |   fin in the country has a nokia phone and i want to eat them  |
     |   all. i seem to have met more ascii artists than any other    !
     |   type of amiga scener while i have been here. a special mention
     |   to all the members of tropic ascii for being so fucking young¡
     |   and tiny! i think i could put them all in my pocket (apart   !
     |   from venturus who is sitting behind me hehe). uhhmmm what more
     |   to say? we are sitting here wathcing the raytracing compo on ¡
     |   the small big screen (well thats what ganja called it) and   |
     |   boheme is screaming away in finnish in my one good ear so i  |
     |   will give him the keys while i go for a cigarette and look   |
     |   to see if i can find a drunken whino to have anal sex with!  |
     |                                                                |
     |   Time to go to syhop\  <-- fOLAR getting desperate! :) Beer is|
     |   the keyword here. Out of words..  "bOhEmE can't type English"|
     |   That was TANGo singing - TANGo the pitmaster TOId. I just    |
     |   luv all these weird EnglishEnglish expressions. Ya know what |

     |    never saw him after it. I bet his with all those alcoholics |
     |    of the city of Helsinki he met last night. They give him    |
     |    free beer anyhow:) My voice is gone.. I have no idea wHY!?  |

          Oh shit..  a while ago I completely trIppEd. Dunno what     |
     .    happened. I just got lost and stuff - lost in my mind. Then |
     |    I got back to this reality and noticed I was walking towards|
     |    cARROLS. Weeeeiird. There was even some lame rave going on. |
     |    Only like 15 ppl dancing. Hshaehah. They had smoke anyhow!  |
     .    I guess tROOPER offered me some logos for this colly, but   |
     |    too fucked up to understand. Whoopsie. And now he's gone.   |
     .    Life IS hard. Buaargh.. drinking WATER. Oh my. I'm gonna    .
     |    take a walk now.                                            .

     |    Finally we got some Amiga to finish this shit on. It's just |
     |    me bOhEmE here 'cause I lost everybody - and I also lost    |
     |    my VOICE! Can't say a word. I guess I was yelling too much  |
     |    last night. pSYKO told us gr8 stories about sTZ showing his |
     |    dick around at the Pasila railway-station. He was doing his |
     |    famous "helikopteri"-move. Oh well. nERVE aXIS saved the    |
     |    Amiga Demo Compo. They're gonna win for sure. I sent rEPE   |
     |    a gsm-txt-msg..  let's see if he can find me..              |
     |                                                                |
     .    fOLAR left this crap party.. he's wise. Oh shit. rEPE and   |
     .    TANGo found me. I was just slaving away with some PPainting |
     |    and they came and killed my inspiration immediatly. Wow!    |
     |    I guess I should pass the keyboard to TANGo - the man (?)   |
     |    who sleeps too much at parties. I guess. 'Cause I've been   |
     |    awake like over 40 hours or something now. HuHeh.sdf..      |
     |                                                                |
     |    Damn these fucking finnish keyboards all the time it is     |

     |    to boycott this event.. (or maybe someone should start sum- |
     |    thin' new instead of this. My machine seems to be in        |
     |    frequent use by all different types of weird 'people'..;)   |
     |    (Hope my HD's still intact after this... well, I'm off bye! |
     |                                                                |
     |   TANGo back fora  few more words. How about this for a slogan |
     |   for the PC people. I came to ASM and played Quake for 3 days |
     |   solid. I spent good money huh? Damn I wonder why they do it. |
     |   Anyway who cares? We have seen Demolee throw his guts up all |
     .   at Boosembly and the disorganiser run into ASM with his balls|
     .   swinging free. I have seen prettier but not funnier haha.    .
     |
     |   PC demo compo is starting so I guess that I have to type     :
     |   something while it is going on. I want to draw ascii but I   ·
     |   think that first I need another fucking cigrarette. Btw who  .
     |   is silly enough to leave a DEC Alpha laptop lying around to  |
     |   be stolen. Its weird ... since it went missing I havent seen |
     |   Stezo around aha ...                                         |
     |                                                                |
     |   The first PC demo sucked major quake-player-cock. They all   |
     |   seem to FUCK UP! HÆhaehaeh..  HAHAha..  fuck PC still rules! |
     |   Booooooooooring... what's the idea to code a fucking anim?!  |
     |   PC's still lacking DESiGN. AND NONE OF THE DEMOS WORK ON THE |
     |   FIRST GO! :)))  Demo #3 was skipped. Demo #4 isn't working!  |
     |   Ok.. now it's running with a fucked up palette. Yiihhaaa..   |
     .                                                                |
     |   Eagarly waiting for #5. Waiting. Waiting. WAITING! WAITING!? |
     |   This is plain silly. PC Scene is getting what it deserves.   |
     |   Waiting.. hehah. They had to skip #6 too. Haha. #7.. eer.    |
     |   The makers are deaf. shit. And blind. They have c64-vectors! |
     |   Another demo..  sucks. Hmm. Predictable? Yeah..  der piipo,  |
     |   frank and dune know what design means. Orange's demo is #1!  |
     |                                                                |
     |   Oh phew..  I'm back home - barely alive. My wisdom tooth is  |
     |   killing me and I still don't have any voice left. Listening  |
     |   to rEPE's kickass compomodule called "Zarina" ! Rules..      |
     |   I guess TANGo and the rest are just about to get on the plane|
     |   back to UK - the bastards won the Amiga Demo Compo!!! They   |
     |   just simply rule! Wow..  I'm freaking out.

     |                                                               /__

     |   And I freked in to give you some of my memoriez from ASM97,  |
     |   since I never managed to write any shit to thiz piece. So    |
     |   it's the author of the sucka module in 4ch compo... hoho.... |
     |     back to the fukkin partys... thursday, picked up dave the  |
     |    toidmastah & nvx winners from the airport, boheme had made  |
     |   nice sign (Mr. Tango / Style). Dunno if he liked it, but it  |
     |   was easy to recognize him. The G. Simmons clone without any  |
     |   surgeries (not 100% sure :)) ... had nice trip with boheme,  |
     |    tango, crash! and zone to boheme's fathers apartment. Zone  |
     |   showed his butt in the front of the boheme's home and tango  |
     |   was chasing that man with a dog ... with his beerbelly. I luv|
     |   it. listened some mika vainio (panasonic dude) and tango was |
     |   singing along trippy samples and weird beats. car's breaks   |
     |   gave some industrial feeling to it with long "quiiiiiiiirhk" |
     |   noises. gotta fix them tho' .o. food. savusiika. yum. skip 2 |
     |   friday, I just finished/polished my tune at thursday and so  |
     |   on... heard that tango & boheme had drinked beer... surprise |
     |   surprise... 8) came to asm with lagers, demolee, hypno (?) ..|
     |     before we started to walk towards pasila railwaystation we |
     |   went to local s-market.. bought some beer. another surprise? |
     |      it was .. midday. Waited for 30mins Folar & STZ at the    |
     |   railwaystation. Bohhohoho. Alpo. Euh. 8) Few mins after they |
     |   came... we saw boheme, psyko and... hmm. don't remember :).. |
     |   oh and Ganja .. Demolee & I went in to buy tickets and return|
     |     our entrys. Damn it was HARD! HARD! HARD! First you had to |
     |   go to terminal (4 or 5 there was) and registrate yourself in |
     |   it gave you your ID number. It was quite confusing to enter  |
     |    those informations about yourself, I think. Or then it was  |
     |   that beer I drank before it. With your ID you went 2 infodesk|
     |    (where fucking many was waiting for getting that badge or   |
     |   piece of paper, dunno how to say it in english 8)...) thanks |
     |   Zeus/now back in STYLE who had waited quite long there. So we|
     |   waited for about 5 mins .. instead of 20-30mins. After they  |
     |    gave you your badge (with name & group on it). I wanted to  |
     |     leave my contribution and go for a beer or ten, they said  |
     |   that we have to go to the terminals again. You can guess how |
     |   many ppl there was waiting to contribute or to registrate... |
     |   fuck it. I gave my id number and password (behind the badge) |
     |   and voila... enter contributes ... enter.. my name was Repe  |
     |     and nick was Repester .. had fucked it up 8) ... Machine   |
     |   wanted to read the disk... surprise that some pc can't read  |
     |   Amiga FFS disk... so I was confused again... but went to the |
     |    infodesk where I had to wait for 10 mins coz my paper said  |
     |   "DIsks read: none" ... ehheeh. Jonne (Meegosh/Movement) was  |
     |   wondering whatta fuck. After 5 mins I asked how long will it |
     |     take ... "Oh, I forgot you..." nice... Maybe better system |
     |   next time, organizers ... I REALLY HOPE SO! Booh. I think it |
     |   after that I wasn't inside at friday. We bought some beer... |
     |   from somewhere... don't remember actually. boozed somewhere. |
     |     oh and I had shower ... a nice one... from football field  |
     |   watering machine or something like that... really freshed me |
     |     up, though Psyko didn't like my belly .. 8) Don't know who |
     |   did. 8) Well, I managed to drink almost all beers before 9pm |
     |   that's why I and boheme went to Teboil ... and they fuckers  |
     |   didn't sell beer. SHit. It was 10 minutes till 9pm. I decided|
     |    to run to the next gas station. Runned like hell, got some  |
     |   little scarfs to my right feet when I was trying to warp up  |
     |   the speed. Shit. I was there 1 minute over 9pm ... and that  |
     |   fat bastard didn't sell me beer. I almost begged on the floor|
     |   but no. Fuck him! Had to walk back... and I was like dead, my|
     |     throat was beggin for beer. But I had left all beers, GSM  |
     |     and all xtra stuff to boheme. Fuck. Well I was quite drunk |
     |   already.. but pissed for a short time after that unsuccessful|
     |   beer hunting. Why can't they sell beer 24h in shops? Fuck the|
     |     laws. Rest of the night I spent with Stylers & other peeps |
     |      from Jormas, NVX and so on. Later that night when I was   |
     |   talkin' to Naks & Raatomestari of Jormas... I lost all other |
     |   guys. Well. Boheme called me sometime ... don't remember when|
     |   or any other ... just figured out that he said they were in  |
     |   some restaurant ... about 4-5km away from me. hmm........... |
     |   Me, Raato and Naks were listening Irwin's (Damones) new tape |
     |   ... HC Hangover VIII ... damn. It was far better than the VII|
     |    but I wonder what kinda tape HC Hangover I is... if someone |
     |   has it, he could email me... and yes. There was Vesuri also..|
     |     he refreshed my memory (which still is quite empty after   |
     |   friday 10-11pm...). Hmm. I slept on the floor of Jormas .... |
     |                       thanks for TERO-DEETSAY-POU for that!    |
     |   single mother home... or something. Warm and soft!           |
     |                                                                |
     |             YOU WANNA EMPTY LINE? HERE YOU HAVE IT!            |
     |                                                                |
     |   Not. Woke up from there... hmm... did something. Then I saw  |
     |   Trooper at the front of Assembly doors... I was about to go  |
     |   home ... shower & wc & food. We came back at 12.xx ... it was|
     |   #10 in 4ch compo ... what they were playing. Well, dunno yet |
     |   what kinda tunes 1-9 were but... #13 was Ganja's ... hehee.. |
     |   Markus you know my comments I think ... it was cool. then #14|
     |     hmm. I liked 80s style when I downloaded my first modules, |
     |   as a joke... it didn't bite me. No. And _MAJOR_ surprise was |
     |   #15. Dunno why they played it but ... some say it rooled.. 8)|
     |   Well, some even voted it, don't know yet how many. Zarina.   |
     |    Well, just leech se-zarin.lha and listen it. You might even |
     |   like it ... if ya like jungle. Dunno what kinda style those  |
     |   top 3 modules were...........................................|

     |   siinä kaljoitellessa. Missed all compos. 8) Thanks for the   |
     | Kinky coffein support & Oblikobli for extrasupport. Like those |
     |            6 pills from Lutka were not enough... 8)            |

     | But they told me that when I was leaving.. fuuuck:) Ho-hum.    |
