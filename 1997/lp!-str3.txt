          :::::::
          :::::::          A paper dated 31 december  1997 glided  over the
          :::::::          empty  roads of  San Rio, just like  a forgotten
          :::::::          dream.Once you experience the dream, and it will
          :::::::          fill you with joy or fear, but  soon as you wake
          :::::::          up, it's all  part of  a life  never lived. That
          :::::::          paper only lives one day.Then, and only then, on
          :::::::          that single day, the paper holds interests. That
          :::::::          paper holds a value, but when a new  dawn rises,
          :::::::          and a new paper  leaves the presses, the old one
          :::::::          isn't worth the shit  on the cerbs. Just for one
          :::::::          day, for  the unmeasurable  moment in  infinity,
          :::::::          that paper goes from riches to rags.From life to
          :::::::          death. Like a  condom, which  is  the vital  key
          :::::::          between life and death. Life is the crime, a new
          :::::::          baby is born, death is the penalty, Aids is your
          :::::::          executioner. For those  brief moments  of inter-
          :::::::          course, a thin layer of latex is what forms your
          :::::::          barrier  against  the  Grim  Reaper. Isn't  that
          :::::::          ironic, the  only thing  that keeps us, mankind,
          :::::::          in  existence, our  way of reproduction, is also
          :::::::          the way for us to kill ourselves.As we travel to
          :::::::          great  hights in our sexual  joys, we  knowingly
          :::::::          choose between life and death.
          :::::::
          :::::::          As that  paper crosses  the pavement,  having no
          :::::::          control of where it  shall travel  to, it enters
          :::::::          an alley. And as the wind gusts  on, lifting  up
          :::::::          the  paper one  last time before dropping  it in
          :::::::          its final resting place, a dark puddle of mud, a
          :::::::          hand  from the  shadow grabs the  paper swiftly,
          :::::::          like an eagle picking up his prey from the water
          :::::::          The man, still  living in a state of  relaxation
          :::::::          caused  by the great  portion of thc and alcohol
          :::::::          still in his  blood, he takes a quick  glance at
          :::::::          the writings, and mumbles:
          ·······
      " damn .. still no bloody snow in the Rockies "
          .......
          :::::::          And for just another  glimps of time,  the paper
          :::::::          had  meaning again  to that man who  now  slowly
          :::::::          planted  one hand on the concreet. Trying to get
          :::::::          on his feet, but his body thinks otherwise.A few
          :::::::          seconds  pass  while  the figure  in  the  alley
          :::::::          stands shacking on his legs. Almost falling over
          :::::::          like an antilope making his first steps.He moves
          :::::::          himself  with the last  strengths in  his  body,
          .......          towards an old chinese restaurant.The sign above

          :::::::          A servant who sees him, quickly aproaches to help

        The solid steel doors, made to withhold even the    :::::::
        heaviest gunfire, spread open like the legs of a    :::::::
        hooker,  leading  you  to her pussy. And  behind    :::::::
        those doors everything was warm.I felt home, the    :::::::
        place where you  lay your head,  after  so  much    :::::::
        travelling.'Cause travelling is what i had done.    :::::::
        I've seen the corners of the world, seen all the    :::::::
        seven  seas,  but  now  i  had  returned. When i    :::::::
        entered, i saw Triv and Axeblade in the  mirror.    :::::::
        They were in the  hot springs tub, together with    :::::::
        some fine chica's, and  my loaded bong  was next    :::::::
        to  the  champagne cooler. I crossed  the lobby,    :::::::
        towards the  steamy bathroom, as  a slurpy sound    :::::::
        grew stronger.It was hard to clearify the sound,    :::::::
        was  it the  movement  of lips on  dicks, or the    :::::::
        buppling of the  water in my bong.The mysts grew    :::::::
        more thick as i walked on ...                       :::::::
                                                            :::::::
  t^  " aahh, yeah baby, giv' it to ma.. nice and sweet "   :::::::

                                                            :::::::
        Since the myst was making it hard for me to see,    :::::::
        i presumed  Trivialos was  talking to one of his    :::::::
        bitches. So it came as a big suprice, when i was    :::::::
        standing toe-touching the tub,  seeying  Trivial    :::::::
        with  his arms  around the bong, holding it like    :::::::
        a newborn baby. Still the slurping sound touched    :::::::
        my earlobes.On the other end of the tub Axeblade    :::::::
        was  sitting, legs wide, as a  head went  up and    :::::::
        down  in de water, like a pump draining  the oil    :::::::
        from this earth.                                    :::::::
                                                            :::::::

        Those were Trivs last words, as his head fell on    :::::::
        some bitches shoulder.I could use a decent bath,    :::::::
        for i  had been laying in  the dirt for a couple    :::::::
        of hours  this morning. Stepping  into  the  hot    :::::::
        water,  those mememories  faded, like  the  dirt    :::::::
        slipping of my skin. I grabbed my bong to take a    :::::::
        few  hits.. puff.. puffff..  puffffff..  it only    :::::::
        took three  strikes to put  me next to Triv,  on    ::::::|

          :::::::
          :::::::
          :::::::          my legs  and body felt  completely  warm, but my
          :::::::          head felt like  stuck to a  piece of gum, when i
          :::::::          woke up. I was still in the hot  tub, we left it
          :::::::          on so it must have  been bubblin'  for like  six
          :::::::          hours. The body  attached to the shoulder i fell
          :::::::          asleep on, was still  in a state of dreams. Triv
          :::::::          on the other hand was already awake, and i heard
          :::::::          the slurpy noise again.
          ·······
  t^  " i didn't wake you man, 'cos .. <sshhllurp>, i didn't now what you
        had done, like say the last couple months .. <puffff>
        so tell me man.. what *is* it you've been doin' all that time "
          .......
          :::::::          So i  started my story, from  the very first day
          :::::::          that i left Amsterdam, 'bout the stewardesses in
          :::::::          the bird, who  stopt serving me  vodka (so i was
          :::::::          forced to get it  myself). About my work  on the
          :::::::          tabaccofarms ( and the  whole lotta  smokin'  we
          :::::::          did), the  nice  hotel in Toronto, the  night it
          :::::::          rained  like hell  in Niagara,  my tour in  NYC,
          :::::::          where i met some phunky  peeps.I continued about
          :::::::          my  trip to Chicago, where i flew  my own plane,
          :::::::          and  where i  met Jonas. The roadtrip to Minnea-
          :::::::          polis,  Swift  Current  (where  our  fuckin' van
          :::::::          broke down), and to Calgary (beers for 25 cents)
          :::::::          After  that  it was  Banff, to  do some  serious
          :::::::          snowboarding in even more  serious  ice, and  my
          :::::::          final resting place  Vancouver, where the lovely
          :::::::          chicks  live (hi  Colombe, Christine, Nicole and
          :::::::          Stef).By the time i came to the end of my story,
          :::::::          the bathroom was crowded. Stratos came strolling
          :::::::          in together with some  chica, and Blade  thought
          :::::::          it was  time for him to  take yet another  bath.
          :::::::          After sitting inside for so long, we all decided
          :::::::          we might  aswell take a ride.No GT's or beamers,
          :::::::          we  took a simple Dodge van,  so the  cops won't
          :::::::          suspect shit. Them gettobirds are  always on our
          :::::::          ass.On our way that shit went a littl' somethin'
          :::::::          like this:
          ·······
  st! " pass the bong man, pass that bong, let me get on this mission like
        Indiana Jones .. "
  rDm " na man.. see, i'm on a mission nigga's say is impossible, but when
        i swing my swords they're all choppable.I'd be the bodydropper, the
        hearbeatstopper .. so watch you're yourself, cos although nigga's
        me be behind ya, don't mean they got your back .. "
   t^ " hey yo blade, where the fuck is it we're goin?!? "
  aB! " fuck i dunno man, but what the fuck is that light above us man, noway
        the getto bird is on us man .. i ain't driving this stinking van for
        no reason! "
  st! " hell yeah, what the fucks that shit man .. think the pigs peeped us
        man?.. damn, gotto be cos Misfit is still laying low, them bitches
        must think we got that nigga here .. like we's stoopid or sumthin "
          .......
          :::::::          As we  all looked at the  bright light up in the
          :::::::          sky, we felt the car suddenly started to move in
          :::::::          the vertical direction.
          ·······
  aB! " fucksake, where fuckin' flying .. this ain't no Will-Smith-im-just-
        cruisin'-kinda-car .. "
  t^  " hell, you think the cops got new tech? "
  rDm " whateva it is, i won't Scotty to beam this baby down! "
  t^  " yo deee, what the fuck did you put in that bong man? .. "
  rDm " shit i dunno man, i didn't load that shit, it was that slave, that
        Gaybird type-o'guy.. "
  t^  " Gaybird?.. the only male slave we have is James.. fuck, you should've
        known not to trust a butler, who's name isn't James "
          .......
          :::::::          We kept argueing about  names of butlers, untill
          :::::::          we we're swallowed  by what  we thought  was the
          :::::::          gettobird. But noway the  pigs owned a heli this
          :::::::          size, so it had to be something else. The answer
          :::::::          was  pretty clear, when a  blue eyed, grey faced
          :::::::          "man"  opened the door to our van. Definetly not
          :::::::          human.                 Oyeah, Triv passed out ..
          ·······
  rDm " where the hell did Spock came from?!?.. imma take my .45 and put a
        cap in his ass "
  aB! " my call .. (as he grabbed his .38)
      " GKs'oGh NarUmjA`di "
  st! " whats mR. Klingon all stressed up 'bout ? "
      " GhjaRikamE SalaMi CaraMbaRes .. <click>
        sorry humans, i forgot to turn on my Acme (tm) Universal Translator
        like i said, your puny little handguns do not server any purpose
        here. You are currently in a Metrical A-directional Forcefield.
        Your firearms will not work in here "
  rDm " whats your name, bubba? "
      " you can call me FOO, i'm here do disgust with you a trade "
  st! " i say we take this Foo peep on with the fists! "
  rDm " lets here what he has got to say, speak your mind FOOl "
  FOO " i heard that .. first, let me take you to our meeting lounge "
          .......
          :::::::          FOO let the way through a long hall.There was no
          :::::::          need to walk, 'cause we were all on one of those
          :::::::          Magic Carpet (tm) thingies (ya know, them moving
          :::::::          sidewalks  you see in the airport,  the ones you
          :::::::          always break your neck on once you step off.. ).
          :::::::          It was a  good thing they had those Magic Carpet
          :::::::          Rides (tm), now we didn't have to carry Trivial.
          :::::::          After he bumped his head a  couple of times when
          :::::::          we crossed an Acme (tm) FOO - Replicator (not to
          :::::::          confuse with Star Trek's Food - Replicators), he
          :::::::          came  by. Through  semi-transparent  windows  we
          :::::::          could see other  aliens  working  in their  high
          :::::::          tech rooms. In one  of those  chambers, i saw 1o
          :::::::          FOO's watching teevee, and i wondered ..
          ·······
  rDm " what is it you guys are doin' in there? "
  FOO " we are studying normal social behavior of the human species "
  rDm " ahh, so you DO have camera's on earth, watchin' our asses 24/7! "
  FOO " no, we got Ricky Lake reruns "
  rDm " doh! "
          .......          We  entered  a  great hall,  which  served  as a
          :::::::          meeting hall. Since we were the only once there,
          :::::::          and  we had already met, the  hall didn't  serve
          :::::::          much of a purpose. FOO started talking to us but
          :::::::          i wasn't really listening.I keept looking around
          :::::::          still  wondering  if this  was not  yet  another
          :::::::          hallucination  of my  twisted mind. As i glanced
          :::::::          around the room, and look at the semitransparent
          :::::::          windows, my eyes met with another pair. Just for
          :::::::          a split second i could have sworn i saw Behemoth
          :::::::          walking in one of the hallways.
          ·······
  FOO " .. so our offer to you is, supreme Alien Technology.Which will put you
        on top of the ascii biz "
   t^ " no fuckin' way we're making a deal with you, i made a pact with the
        devil, and already is one deal to many "
  st! " yah, we don't need no Alien Tech to help our asses, we's on top of
        everybody .. specially females "
  FOO " i was afraid you might react like this.Those Ricky reruns paid off
        in the long run.Therefor we imprisoned one of your members.Misfit
        is currently held in one of our torture chambers "
  rDm " i know Misfit, no torture is too hard for him, he won't budge "
  FOO " we are making him watch Pioneer Design collections, day in day out,
        week in week out.. "
  rDm " damn, no mortal man can withstand that, we gotto do sumthin' "
          .......
          :::::::          My  mind  started  running  like Carl  Lewis, my
          :::::::          braincells "twistin and turning" like the Chilli
          :::::::          Peppers. And  then an  image came to me, a  sign
          :::::::          saying  "keep out". So it was  definetly a place
          :::::::          for us to visit. Now to let the rest of the crew
          :::::::          know i had a plan.. well, sort of ..
          ·······
  rDm " when i raise my trigger finger .. "
        <BLAAMMM>
   t^ " all you nigga's hit the decks! "
          .......
          :::::::          With a  fast right hand, one  you certainly  did
          :::::::          not expect from Triv, he knocked down the alien.
          :::::::          Then we had to act fast, 2fast actually, because
          :::::::          we already heard a noise of an alarm  in the far
          :::::::          distance.Stratos pulled out his swiss army knife
          :::::::          and cut of the head of FOO, while Triv undressed
          :::::::          After  the brains  were sucked  out of the  head
          :::::::          (and after i  swallowed them, i was in  need  of
          :::::::          some  fresh  cells)  Triv  fitted  on for  size.
          :::::::          Perfect fit (wadda ya expect, it had a  tag; one
          :::::::          size  fits all.. ).Then we swiftly moved back to
          :::::::          the FOO - Replicator,  where  Triv  stepped  in,
          :::::::          only  his head sticking out.Another slurpy noise
          :::::::          was heard, this  time it was the machine placing
          :::::::          Trivial in a new body. As he stepped  out of the
          :::::::          apparatus a group of FOO-likes  came rushing in.
          ·······
 FOO1 " is their a problem here? "
  t^ (now in disguse as FOO) " nope officer.. i mean, no, no problem here,
        this human here just passed out, and we must take him with us "
 FOO1 " ahh, he's hit the bong one to many times .. haha "
  t^  " well actually .. "
          .......
          :::::::          We  immediatly grabbed Triv and  walked on,  not
          :::::::          wanting  him to  start a  discussion on the fact
          :::::::          that  you  can never  hit a  bong to long. So we
          :::::::          walked  down the corridor, when  all of a sudden
          :::::::          we saw Ramon standing puffing a big owl.
          ·······
  st! " yo Ramones, wassup man! "
  rN! " hey yo, im just chillin' here man.. <pufff>, here Red hold my shit
        for a sec man "
  st! " how the hell did you end up here? "
  rN! " man, i was just mindin' ma own biz, workin' on my shrooms, when
        suddenly this big-'o-ass light was above me. I thought, damn, i
        can grow some serious weed underneath that lamp!
        Then i was beamed up, and i met up with some peep named DOO.
        Well, i passed him the spliff, and he was out after one suck...
        so i had to roll another one 'cause that DOOd was droolin' all
        over it .. then you guys were standing next to me, like you're
        doin' rite at this very moment "
  st! " well, we gotto find Misfit, and blow this popsticklejoint "
  rN! " what JOINT!? .. ahh. .oh yeah "
          .......
          :::::::          We  continued our  way passing all  the windows,
          :::::::          now  running  on the Magic  Carpet Ride (tm). We
          :::::::          just kept  running as fast as  our  legs  could,
          :::::::          faster and faster, pushing harder and harder. We
          :::::::          were so  focused on getting to Misfit, we didn't
          :::::::          notice we were on the wrong Ride, walkin against
